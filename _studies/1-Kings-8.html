<p>1 Samuel 2: Seven Lessons from Hannah’s Praises and the Sins of Eli’s Sons on True Worship</p>
<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span>: During the time of the Judges, Israel drifted into sin because the priesthood had fallen into sin (Jdgs. 21:25). Before God would restore Israel’s civic leadership, He first had to restore the priesthood. Spiritual revival must precede any attempt at physical or civic restoration or it will fail in the long term. Samuel brought the restoration of the priesthood. Jesus later brought this chance at spiritual restoration to everyone. Both Hannah and later Mary celebrated the restoration of their time despite having endured terrible personal hardships. From Hannah’s song of praise and the virtue of Samuel in comparison to the counterfeit priesthood under Eli, God reveals seven lessons about true worship. True worship includes (1) thanksgiving; (2) humility; (3) self-denial; (4) faithfulness; (5) purity; (6) repentance; and (7) service.</p>
<p><span class="underline">First</span>, Hannah had just given away her only son Samuel. Yet, she still sang a song of thanksgiving. From this, God reveals that true worship includes singing His praises, even in your times of sorrow. <span class="underline">Second</span>, after praising God for what He did for her, Hannah praised God in humility for His sovereign power over all. From this, God reveals that true worship is manifested by trusting in His sovereign will and acting with humility. <span class="underline">Third</span>, <strong>unlike Samuel, the sons of Eli used God’s gifts to indulge themselves. From their sins, God reveals that true worship includes self-denial</strong> for Him. <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, <strong>in contrast to the wicked family of Eli, Samuel, Hannah, and Elkanah remained faithful in serving God. From their holy example, God reveals that true worship is manifested through maintaining a faithful heart toward Him.</strong> <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, the sons of Eli blasphemed God through horrible sexual sins. From their sins, God reveals that true worship includes being pure and set apart for His use. <span class="underline">Sixth</span>, the greatest of Eli’s sons’ sins was in failing to repent. Because Eli’s sons would not repent, God ultimately judged them. From this, God reveals that true worship includes repentance when you sin. <span class="underline">Finally</span>, God promised to raise up a new priesthood. This foreshadowed Samuel in the short term and Jesus in the long term. With Jesus as your High Priest, you can become part of His royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). You can show your living worship by serving Him with works of love (Jam. 2:17).</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">Thanksgiving: Praise God For Everything, Even in Your Sorrow</span>. 1 Sam. 2:1-2.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Hannah’s song of thanksgiving</span>. Hannah had just given away her only son (1 Sam. 1:28). While most would weep in sorrow, she sang a song of praise: “<sup>1 </sup><em>Then Hannah prayed and said, ‘My heart exults in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; my horn is exalted in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, my mouth speaks boldly against my enemies, because I rejoice in Your salvation. <sup>2 </sup>There is no one holy like the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, indeed, there is no one besides You, nor is there any rock like our God</em>.” (1 Sam. 2:1-2). Her song in times of sorrow is recorded for your instruction (Ro. 15:5; 2 Tim. 3:16). If you have suffered a loss or illness, “in everything give thanks; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus.” (1 Thess. 5:18). “always giving thanks for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;” (Eph. 5:20).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Hannah’s power was perfected when she exalted the Lord</span>. Hannah prayed “<em>my horn is exalted in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em> <span class="smallcaps">. . .”</span> (1 Sam. 2:1). In the Bible, horns symbolize power, strength, and refuge (Dt. 33:17; Ps. <em><strong>18:2; 75:4-5, 10; 89:17; 92:10; Lk. 1:69; Lam. 2:3; 1 Kgs. 1:50; 2:28).</strong></em> Hannah also revealed that God was her “rock”, another reference to her strength (1 Sam 2:2). Moses revealed that God was also the “rock” of Israel (Dt. 32:30-31). Jesus can also be your rock (the rejected “chief cornerstone”) and your strength when you submit Him (Ps. 118:22; Matt. 21:42; Mk. 12:10; Lk. 20:17; Acts 4:11; Ro. 9:33). <em><strong>In her submission to God, He gave her the power to speak “</strong>boldly against my enemies</em>. . .” (1 Sam. 2:1). Have you submitted to Jesus to let Him be your strength?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Mary’s similar song of thanksgiving</span>. Centuries later, Mary gave a similar song of praise after her virgin birth to the Messiah Jesus: “And Mary said: ‘My soul exalts the Lord, And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior. For He has had regard for the humble state of His bondslave; for behold, from this time on all generations will count me blessed. For the Mighty One has done great things for me; and holy is His name. And His mercy is upon generation after generation toward those who fear Him.” (Lk. 1:46-50). God wants you to follow the examples of Hannah and Mary to sing your own song of praises.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God is unique and comparable to no one</span>. Hannah praised God as being unique in His holiness: “<em>There is no one holy like the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>,</em>. . .” (1 Sam. 2:2). Moses made a similar claim in his song of deliverance after God defeated Pharaoh’s army: “Who is like You among the gods, O LORD? Who is like You, majestic in holiness, awesome in praises, working wonders?” (Ex. 15:11). As one commentator notes: “This shows a classic form of Hebrew poetry - repetitive parallelism. To say the Lord is <strong>holy</strong> is to say He is completely set apart; that He is unique, and not like any other. When she continued in the same verse and said, ‘<strong>For there is none besides You</strong>,’ she said the same thing as ‘<strong>There is none holy like the Lord</strong>,’ only saying it in different words. When she said, ‘<strong>Nor is there any rock like our God</strong>,’ she again says the same thing in different words. . . . In this, Hebrew poetry does not rhyme words by sound as much as it rhymes <em>ideas</em>. The ideas of the three lines of 1 Samuel 2:2 all rhyme together, having different words yet ‘sounding’ the same.” (David Guzik on 1 Samuel 2). If you feel that no one can understand or help you, God is unique and can always help you in your struggles.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <span class="underline">Humility: Praise God with Humility Before His Sovereign Power</span>. 1 Sam. 2:3-10.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Hannah’s praise for God’s sovereignty</span>. After praising God for what He did for her, Hannah praised God’s sovereign power over all: “<sup>3 </sup>Boast no more so very proudly, do not let arrogance come out of your mouth; for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is a God of knowledge, and with Him actions are weighed. <sup>4 </sup>The bows of the mighty are shattered, but the feeble gird on strength. <sup>5 </sup>Those who were full hire themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry cease to hunger. Even the barren gives birth to seven, but she who has many children languishes. <sup>6 </sup>The <span class="smallcapsexhorting them to trust in God&lt;/span&gt;. Faced with a numerically and technologically superior enemy, the Jews panicked in fear. As their leader, Saul failed to bolster the people’s faith by urging them to trust in God: “&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now the Philistines assembled to fight with Israel, 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and people like the sand which is on the seashore in abundance; and they came up and camped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven. &lt;sup&gt;6 &lt;/sup&gt;When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were hard-pressed), then the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in cliffs, in cellars, and in pits. &lt;sup&gt;7 &lt;/sup&gt;Also some of the Hebrews crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. But as for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling&lt;/em&gt;.” (1 Sam. 13:5-7). The people wanted a leader like the other pagan nations around them to fight their enemies (1 Sam. 8:5). They rejected God as their king (1 Sam. 8:7). Saul was exactly like the pagan leaders. His faith was weak. Thus, he did not tell the people to trust in God to deliver them. Without a faithful leader guiding them, the people suffered without hope. Their faith in Saul was useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=" data-underline"="">When the Jews put their faith in God, God terrorized the Jews’ enemies</span>. If Saul had faith, he would have reminded the Jews that God was faithful to keep His promise to cause the Jews’ enemies to fear them: “I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.” (Ex. 23:27). ‘“This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under the heavens, who, when they hear the report of you, will tremble and be in anguish because of you.’” (Dt. 2:25). “I will send an angel before you and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite.” (Ex. 33:2). His power defeated Pharaoh’s army at the Red Sea. His power also defeated the kings of Jordan. His power also delivered the Promised Land to the Jews. He wants you to know that He is powerful enough to fulfill His promises to you as well. Yet, if you don’t know His promises, how much faith can you have in them? If you have a leadership role like Saul, are you encouraging others?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">When you walk with God, He promises to cause your enemies to fear you as well</span>. God also promises that an obedient individual or nation will receive the fear or respect from his or its enemies: “So all the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and they will be afraid of you.” (Dt. 28:10). In the Bible, there are many examples of when other nations feared the Jews because of God. For example, Pharaoh feared God’s wrath when he almost took Abraham’s wife Sarah as his wife (Gen. 12:17-20). Likewise, after defeating the Amorites, the Jews traveled back to the plains of Moab where they stayed until God gave the word for Joshua to take them into the Promised Land (Nu. 22:1). There, the Moabites feared the Jews (Nu. 22:3-4). Their fear caused the Moabite King Balak to hire the sorcerer Balaam in an unsuccessful attempt to cast a spell on Israel (Nu. 22:7). The kings of Canaan again feared the Jews and their God when they invaded. The Canaanites “heard how the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the sons of Israel until they had crossed, that their hearts melted, and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the sons of Israel.” (Josh. 5:1). “Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed; the leaders of Moab, trembling grips them; all the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away. Terror and dread fall upon them; by the greatness of Your arm they are motionless as stone; until Your people pass over, O LORD, until the people pass over whom You have purchased.” (Ex. 15:15-16). All who oppose Israel are subject to the curse that God promised to Abraham (Gen. 12:3). Today, the nations that surround Israel again fear it because God has blessed it. Are you walking with God to allow His Holy Spirit to cause your enemies to fear or respect you?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">With faith, God will also give you the courage to face your enemies</span>. Unlike the Jews under Saul, God wants you to have faith in Him when facing your battles. Without faith, it is impossible to please Him: “And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.” (Heb. 11:6). He has given you a Spirit of strength, not fear: “For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline.” (2 Tim. 1:7). Are you acting boldly in faith for His glory? Are you letting fear rule any portion of your life? If so, repent of your fear and trust in Jesus to deliver you.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3. <span class="underline">An Ungodly Leader is Disobedient to God and Acts Presumptuously</span>. 1 Sam. 13:8-9.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Saul’s failure to wait for God’s timing and his sin of presumption</span>. Saul knew that he needed God’s help. Yet, he was unwilling to wait on Samuel to make sacrifices. Thus, Saul thought that he could force God to help by making the sacrifices on his own. “<sup>8 </sup><em>Now he waited seven days, according to the appointed time set by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering from him. <sup>9 </sup>So Saul said, ‘Bring to me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.’ And he offered the burnt offering</em>.” (1 Sam. 13:8-9). Here, Saul committed sins including disobedience and presumption.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Saul’s sin of disobedience</span>. Samuel told Saul to wait seven days at a place called Gilgal before he would come. The place and the duration of the wait should have sounded familiar to Saul. At this exact same place, Samuel told Saul to wait seven days before his anointing as king. “And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to you to offer burnt offerings and sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you should do.” (1 Sam. 10:8). God tested Saul’s obedience and his patience. Saul passed God’s test of waiting seven days when there was no pressure. Yet, he was unwilling to wait when the stakes were high. Just as Saul had to patently wait seven days for his anointing, he had to wait patiently for God to deliver the Jews from the Philistines. Samuel later explained that God values obedience over sacrifice. “Samuel said, ‘Has the LORD as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams.” (1 Sam. 15:22). Unlike Saul, God wants you to be obedient by waiting on His timing. “Rest in the LORD and wait patiently for Him; do not fret because of him who prospers in his way, because of the man who carries out wicked schemes.” (Ps. 37:7). “I waited patiently for the LORD; and He inclined to me and heard my cry.” (Ps. 40:1(b)). “I wait for the LORD, my soul does wait, and in His word do I hope.” (Ps. 130:5). Do you also patently wait upon the Lord and His timing?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Saul’s sin of presumption</span>. Moses warned the Jews not to act presumptuously by acting without the direction of the priests. Those who failed to do so would be judged: “The man who acts presumptuously by not listening to the priest who stands there to serve the LORD your God, nor to the judge, that man shall die; thus you shall purge the evil from Israel.” (Dt. 17:12). Saul presumed that he could fulfill the role of God’s priest when that was not his role. When the Philistines previously attacked the Jews while Samuel made a burnt offering at Mizaph, God responded by routing the Philistines “Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, and the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day against the Philistines and confused them, so that they were routed before Israel.” (1 Sam. 7:10). Saul apparently presumed that he could force God to intervene by simply repeating Samuel’s prior actions. He made the sacrifices a good luck charm the same way the Jews previously turned the ark into a good luck charm (1 Sam. 4:3-10). The Jews also made the sin of presumption by trying to invade the Promised Land after God judged them and told them that the first generation would need to die off in the wilderness because of their sins. “So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. Instead you rebelled against the command of the LORD, and <span class="underline">acted presumptuously</span> and went up into the hill country. The Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do, and crushed you from Seir to Hormah. Then you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD did not listen to your voice nor give ear to you. So you remained in Kadesh many days, the days that you spent <em>there.”</em> (Dt. 1:41-46). Many years later, King Uzziah also acted presumptuously when he tried to serve as both priest and as king. God responded by striking him with leprosy (2 Chr. 26:18-19). Never assume that you are following God’s will when you are either disobeying His Word or acting on your own.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <span class="underline">An Ungodly Leader Fails to Repent When Confronted with His Sins</span>. 1 Sam. 13:10-12.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Saul’s failure to repent when confronted</span>. When Samuel confronted Saul for his sins, Saul offered excuses and refused to repent. “<sup>10 </sup><em>As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him and to greet him. <sup>11 </sup>But Samuel said, ‘What have you done?’ And Saul said, ‘Because I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the appointed days, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash, <sup>12 </sup>therefore I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not asked the favor of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>.’ So I forced myself and offered the burnt offering</em>.’” (1 Sam. 13:10-12). In most English translations, it states that Saul came out to meet Samuel. Yet, the Hebrew suggests that he wanted to bless Saul. This suggests that Saul was attempting to impress Samuel with his piety. When Samuel confronted Saul, Saul showed his piety to be false when he blamed others for his actions. He then blamed Samuel for coming at the last possible moment.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">When God has revealed your sins, repent</span>. When Samuel revealed Saul’s sins, Saul should have repented: “When Your people Israel are defeated before an enemy, because they have sinned against You, if they turn to You again and confess Your name and pray and make supplication to You in this house, then hear in heaven, and forgive the sin of Your people Israel, and bring them back to the land which You gave to their fathers. When the heavens are shut up and there is no rain, because they have sinned against You, and they pray toward this place and confess Your name and turn from their sin when You afflict them, then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of Your servants and of Your people Israel, indeed, teach them the good way in which they should walk. And send rain on Your land, which You have given Your people for an inheritance.” (1 Kgs. 8:33-36). When Joshua and his men sinned at Ai by acting presumptuously, he tore his clothes in grief and cried out for God not to allow His name to be profaned by their sins: ‘“<sup>9</sup> For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name?’” (Josh. 7:9). When God reveals your sins, do you repent so that you can be forgiven? (1 Jo. 1:9).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Humble yourself so that you will accept correction</span>. Instead of hardening his heart with excuses, God wanted Saul to circumcise his heart so that he would accept Samuel’s correction. “<em>So circumcise your heart, and stiffen your neck no longer.</em>” (Dt. 10:16; 30:6; Ro. 2:28-29; <strong>Col. 2:10-11).</strong> When you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior and allow the Holy Spirit to guide you, He will also circumcise your heart if you let Him: “in Him you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, in the removal of the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ;” (Col. 2:11). When you soften or circumcise your heart, God will reward you with a heart to know Him: “I will give them a heart to know Me, for I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me with their whole heart.” (Jer. 24:7). “But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days,” declares the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, “I will put My law within them and on their heart I will write it; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.” (Jer. 31:33; Col. 2:11). In the areas where are you stiff necked in your walk with God, will you invite the Holy Spirit to soften your heart?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5. <span class="underline">An Ungodly Leader Will Be Judged For Unrepentant Sins</span>. 1 Sam. 13:13-14.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Saul’s judgment for his unrepentant sins</span>. Because Samuel failed to repent of sins, God judged him as an unfit leader. Yet, out of mercy and grace, God withheld his immediate punishment and limited it to Saul’s future generations. “<sup>13 </sup><em>Samuel said to Saul, ‘You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, which He commanded you, for now the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. <sup>14 </sup>But now your kingdom shall not endure. The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has sought out for Himself a man after His own heart, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has appointed him as ruler over His people, because you have not kept what the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> commanded you</em>.’” (1 Sam. 13:13-14). Some might think that Samuel overreacted. Yet, Saul was God’s anointed representative. Just as Moses was held to a higher standard as His representative, so was Saul. Had Saul been faithful and obedient, God would have established Saul’s dynasty forever. Now, God would appoint a representative with the right heart. God, however, showed mercy and grace by delaying Saul’s punishment. God allowed Saul to rule for another 20 years to give him the chance to repent, an opportunity that Saul would squander.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God cares more about your heart than your actions</span>. God promised that He would appoint: “<em>a man after His own heart, and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has appointed him as ruler over His people,</em>” (1 Sam. 13:14). This was a prophesy that God would one day appoint David as king. “After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, ‘I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My heart, who will do all My will.’” (Acts 13:22). Pastor David Guzik gives several reasons why David and not Saul was a man after God’s heart: “i. <em>A man after God's heart honors the Lord.</em> Saul was more concerned with his will than God’s will. David knew God’s will was most important. Even when David didn’t do God’s will, he still knew God’s will was more important. All sin is a disregard of God, but David sinned more out of weakness and Saul more out of a disregard for God. ii. <em>A man after God's heart enthrones God as king</em>. For Saul, <em>Saul</em> was king. For David, the <em>Lord God</em> was king. Both David and Saul knew sacrifice before battle was important. But David thought it was important because it pleased and honored God. Saul thought it was important because it might help him win the battle. Saul thought God would help him achieve his goals. David thought that God was the goal. iii. <em>A man after God’s heart has a soft, repentant heart</em>. When Saul was confronted with his sin he offered excuses. When David was confronted with his sin he confessed his sin and repented (2 Samuel 12:13). iv. <em>A man after God’s heart loves other people</em>. Saul became increasingly bitter against people and lived more and more unto himself, but David loved people. When David was down and out he still loved and served those who were even more down and out (1 Sam. 22:1-2).” (David Guzik on 1 Sam. 13). Is your heart burdened by worldly or godly things?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6. <span class="underline">An Ungodly Leader Can Cause God to Remove a Nation’s Protections</span>. 1 Sam. 13:15-18.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Saul’s sins removed God’s hedge of protection from the Philistine’s raids</span>. Saul’s sins not only had consequences for his family. They also caused the nation to suffer as God removed His hedge of protection. “<sup>15 </sup><em>Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men. <sup>16 </sup>Now Saul and his son Jonathan and the people who were present with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin while the Philistines camped at Michmash. <sup>17 </sup>And the raiders came from the camp of the Philistines in three companies: one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual, <sup>18 </sup>and another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another company turned toward the border which overlooks the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness</em>.” (1 Sam. 13:15-18). Saul’s army was reduced to one-fifth of its size, from 3,000 to a mere 600 men (1 Sam. 13:2, 8). Saul was from the tribe of Benjamin. God previously judged his tribe and reduced it to a mere 600 men after their sexual sins and their refusal to repent during Israel’s first civil war. “<sup>47 </sup>But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they remained at the rock of Rimmon four months.” (Jdgs. 20:47). In the Bible, the number six symbolizes man because God made mankind on His sixth creation day. The number 600 symbolized mankind’s judgment. Because of the evil desires within their hearts, all mankind has been ensnared by sin and is under judgment: “By transgression an evil man is ensnared, but the righteous sings and rejoices.” (Prov. 29:6; 11:5; 5:22; Ro. 3:23). Thus, every person must repent and turn to Christ to be saved from certain judgment (Jo. 3:16). This was something that neither Saul nor his tribe was willing to do.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Fighting your battles without God frequently leads to defeat</span>. The 600 men that were left with Saul could never have defeated the Philistines on their own. God warns that if His people refuse to repent and turn back to Him, He may allow them to be defeated in battle: “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> shall cause you to be defeated before your enemies; you will go out one way against them, but you will flee seven ways before them, and you will be <em>an example of</em> terror to all the kingdoms of the earth.” (Dt. 28:25). “I will set My face against you so that you will be struck down before your enemies; and those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you.” (Lev. 26:17). When the Jews were disobedient to God, they were defeated in battle: “The Philistines drew up in battle array to meet Israel. When the battle spread, Israel was defeated before the Philistines who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield.” (1 Sam. 4:2). “So the Philistines fought and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent; and the slaughter was very great, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.” (1 Sam. 4:10). Are you trying to fight your battles without God? If so, you are unlikely to be successful.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>7. <span class="underline">An Ungodly Leader Can Cause a Nation to Feel Helpless Without God</span>. 1 Sam. 13:19-23.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Saul’s sins left the Jews helpless from the enemy’s attacks</span>. Without God’s protection, the Jews were also left helpless without iron weapons against a more technologically advanced enemy: “<sup>19 </sup><em>Now no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, ‘Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears.’ <sup>20 </sup>So all Israel went down to the Philistines, each to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, and his hoe. <sup>21 </sup>The charge was two-thirds of a shekel for the plowshares, the mattocks, the forks, and the axes, and to fix the hoes. <sup>22 </sup>So it came about on the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hands of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan, but they were found with Saul and his son Jonathan. <sup>23 </sup>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash</em>.” (1 Sam. 13:19-23). The Philistines had so effectively cut off the Jews access to military technology that only the royal family had iron weapons. God was removing everything that the Jews could do to rely upon themselves. He did this so that the Jews would learn to trust Him alone.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Living outside of God’s protections will leave you helpless before your enemy</span>. For a wayward society or individual, there is no protection without God. Like an exposed carcass, the wayward person or society will be weak and unable to stop those who might prey upon them: “Your carcasses will be food to all birds of the sky and to the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten <em>them</em> away.” (Dt. 28:26). “As for those of you who may be left, I will also bring weakness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf will chase them, and even when no one is pursuing they will flee as though from the sword, and they will fall.” (Lev. 26:36). “The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, . . . so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.” (Josh. 2:14). “The LORD has done what He purposed; He has accomplished His word which He commanded from days of old. . . . He has exalted the might of your adversaries.” (Lam. 2:17). “I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hand of those who seek their life; and I will give over their carcasses as food for the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth.” (Jer. 19:7; 7:33; Ps. 79:2). “The wicked flee when no one is pursuing, but the righteous are bold as a lion.” (Prov. 28:1). If you are fighting your battles without God, you may eventually feel powerless against enemies and forces that you cannot control. Give these battles to God and live in peace.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The sins of a leader can affect the entire community</span>. Saul’s actions show that the ungodly actions of one leader can impact an entire nation. Hundreds of years earlier, Joshua reminded the people that the sin of one person caused the entire nation to lose in battle: ‘“Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in the things under the ban, and wrath fall on all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.’” (Josh. 22:20). Solomon also warned that: “Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.” (Ecc. 9:18). Christians cannot turn a blind eye toward the sins of their leaders. Believers are meant to be His salt and light on Earth (Matt. 5:13-16). Salt stings when it is applied to the wound of sin. If the Church ceases to be an irritant toward sin in the world, it will lose its saltiness and become worthless in Jesus’ eyes: “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt has become tasteless, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.” (Matt. 5:13). These verses challenge the libertarian world view that has invaded the Church. The Church falls short of God’s calling when it ceases to irritate the immoral society around it. The Church has largely stopped speaking out against sin in society in the hopes of being seeker friendly to nonbelievers. The result is a Church that has lost its saltiness. Are you praying for the nation’s leaders to repent?</p></li>

<p>le heart they speak.” (Ps. 12:2). “His mouth is full of curses and deceit and oppression; under his tongue is mischief and wickedness.” (Ps. 10:7). “For they have opened the wicked and deceitful mouth against me; they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.” (Ps. 109:2). “Lying lips are detestable to the LORD, but faithful people are His delight.” (Prov. 12:22). If you are using deceit, you are using the devil’s tactics.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Absalom and Adonijah were like counterfeit Christ’s</span>. Through their evil schemes against their father, Absalom and Adonijah were like the false messiah, who will plot evil schemes against the Father: “Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned, and turn away from them. For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites; and by their smooth and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.” (Ro. 16:17-18). God “will condemn a man who devises evil.” (Prov. 12:2(b)). God provides these examples to warn that Satan will use the same schemes to deceive government leaders. Thus, you must test every leader who seeks to lead you.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Satan’s plans to use deceit to turn people against Jesus</span>. Like Absalom and Adonijah, Satan seeks to deceive mankind. For many, he has become either the “god of this world” (2 Cor. 4:4), “the prince of this world” (Jo. 12:31), or the “prince of the power of the air” (Eph. 2:2). Any time you refuse to submit to God, you let Satan rule over your life. Yet, if you have accepted Christ as your Lord you need not fear. “You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.” (1 Jo. 4:4). Thus, even though he can cause you pain, the Holy Spirit inside you can protect you from any evil scheme that Satan may try to inflict upon you.</p>
<p>3. <span class="underline">Submissive: God’s Leaders Should Submit in Faith to His Word</span>. 1 Kgs. 1:11-27.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Bathsheba and Nathan exhort David to keep God’s Word and anoint Solomon as king</span>. After learning of Adonijah’s acts to anoint himself as king, the prophet Nathan and Bathsheba worked together to prompt David to honor his commitment to anoint Solomon as the next king of Israel: “<sup>11 </sup><em>Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, ‘Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king, and David our lord does not know it? <sup>12 </sup>So now come, please let me give you counsel and save your life and the life of your son Solomon. <sup>13 </sup>Go at once to King David and say to him, ‘Have you not, my lord, O king, sworn to your maidservant, saying, ‘Surely Solomon your son shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then has Adonijah become king?’” <sup>14 </sup>‘Behold, while you are still there speaking with the king, I will come in after you and confirm your words.’ <sup>15 </sup>So Bathsheba went in to the king in the bedroom. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king. <sup>16 </sup>Then Bathsheba bowed and prostrated herself before the king. And the king said, ‘What do you wish?’ <sup>17 </sup>She said to him, ‘My lord, you swore to your maidservant by the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, saying, ‘Surely your son Solomon shall be king after me and he shall sit on my throne.’ <sup>18 </sup>Now, behold, Adonijah is king; and now, my lord the king, you do not know it. <sup>19 </sup>He has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king and Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited Solomon your servant. <sup>20 </sup>As for you now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. <sup>21 </sup>Otherwise it will come about, as soon as my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be considered offenders.’ <sup>22 </sup>Behold, while she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. <sup>23 </sup>They told the king, saying, ‘Here is Nathan the prophet.’ And when he came in before the king, he prostrated himself before the king with his face to the ground. <sup>24 </sup>Then Nathan said, ‘My lord the king, have you said, ‘Adonijah shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne’? <sup>25 </sup>For he has gone down today and has sacrificed oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons and the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest, and behold, they are eating and drinking before him; and they say, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ <sup>26 </sup>But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and your servant Solomon, he has not invited. <sup>27 </sup>Has this thing been done by my lord the king, and you have not shown to your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</em>”’ (1 Kgs. 1:11-27). Nathan was the one who conveyed God’s eternal covenant with David (2 Sam. 7:8-17). Thus, he knew God’s will. God had also declared that it was His will for Solomon to serve as the next king (1 Chr. 22:9-10). Although David’s relationship with Bathsheba was originally born out of lust and adultery (2 Sam. 11), God granted them mercy and grace. And she became very close to David as his queen. Nathan warned Bathsheba that both her life and Solomon’s life were in danger if Adonijah consolidated his power as king (1 Kgs. 1:12). While David showed mercy to rivals to the throne, Adonijah would not do the same. He was an evil man who would follow the ways of the world by killing his rivals.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God is sovereign, and His will cannot be changed by mankind</span>. As God’s prophet, Nathan reminded David that His covenant with David ran through Solomon, not Adonijah: ‘“Behold, a son will be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies on every side; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days. He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.”’ (1 Chr. 22:9-10). God’s prophesy shows that He is sovereign and has control over kings, nations, and all time. Adonijah could not usurp God’s will. Daniel explained: “It is He who changes the times and the epochs; He removes kings and establishes kings; He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to men of understanding.” (Da. 2:21). “He makes the nations great, then destroys them; He enlarges the nations, then leads them away.” (Job 12:23). “Behold, the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are regarded as a speck of dust on the scales; behold, He lifts up the islands like fine dust.” (Is. 40:15). “All the nations are as nothing before Him, they are regarded by Him as less than nothing and meaningless.” (Is. 40:17). “The LORD is King forever and ever; nations have perished from His land.” (Ps. 10:16). “You shall multiply the nation, You shall increase their gladness; . . .” (Is. 9:3(a)). “All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing, but He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the inhabitants of earth; and no one can ward off His hand or say to Him, ‘What have You done?’” (Dan. 4:35). Even in hard times, do you trust that God is fully in control?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God picked Israel’s King to serve the King of Kings</span>. When Moses prophesized of the day when Israel would demand a king, he warned that God as the King of Kings would select the kings: “you shall surely set a king over you <em>whom the LORD your God chooses</em>, one from among your countrymen you shall set as king over yourselves; you may not put a foreigner over yourselves who is not your countryman.” (Dt. 17:17). Moses gave this counsel so that no king would boast that he became king based upon his own merit. The people previously wanted Saul as king because they wanted to be “like all the nations” (1 Sam. 8:5). Yet, God wants His people to be set apart to serve Him, not themselves.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <span class="underline">Obedient: God’s Leaders Should be Obedient to His Word</span>. 1 Kgs. 1:28-37.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">David is obedient to God’s Word and anoints Solomon king</span>. Although David was a sinner, he was faithful to keep his vows after being reminded of God’s Word: “<sup>28 </sup><em>Then King David said, “Call Bathsheba to me.” And she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king. <sup>29 </sup>The king vowed and said, ‘As the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> lives, who has redeemed my life from all distress, <sup>30 </sup>surely as I vowed to you by the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> the God of Israel, saying, ‘Your son Solomon shall be king after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place’; I will indeed do so this day.’ <sup>31 </sup>Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground, and prostrated herself before the king and said, ‘May my lord King David live forever.’ <sup>32 </sup>Then King David said, ‘Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada.’ And they came into the king’s presence. <sup>33 </sup>The king said to them, ‘Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. <sup>34 </sup>Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel, and blow the trumpet and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ <sup>35 </sup>Then you shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne and be king in my place; for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah.’ <sup>36 </sup>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king and said, ‘Amen! Thus may the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of my lord the king, say. <sup>37 </sup>As the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has been with my lord the king, so may He be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David!</em>”’ (1 Kgs. 1:28-37). After being reminded of his prior oath (1 Chr. 22:9-10), David vowed to uphold his oath to make Solomon the next king (1 Kgs. 1:29-30). David did not just reaffirm his vow because he made it. He reaffirmed his vow because he recognized that it was the will of God his “redeemer” (1 Kgs. 1:29). Through the Holy Spirit, Bathsheba blessed David with God’s promise of eternal life for his faithfulness (1 Kgs. 1:31). David then demonstrated his obedience by quickly assembling his loyal priest Zadok, his prophet Nathan, and Benaiah the captain of his guards, to officially anoint Solomon as king (1 Kgs. 1:32-34). By entrusting the priest and prophet to conduct the official anointing, David put his faith in God and not in himself to control the succession. Both before David and after him, God identified His chosen kings through His prophets, not through His kings (1 Sam. 10:1; 16:13; 1 Kgs. 11:37; 15:28-29; 16:12; 2 Kgs. 9:3).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Obedience was a central principle of the Old Testament</span>. Moses repeatedly stressed the importance of obedience: “You shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you, that you may live and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you will possess.” (Dt. 5:33; 4:1, 40; 5:29; 6:3; 10:12; 12:28). David likewise stressed the importance of obedience: “I am small and despised, yet I do not forget Your precepts.” (Ps. 119:141). “The cords of the wicked have encircled me, but I have not forgotten Your law.” (Ps. 119:61). Solomon also implored others to be obedient: “My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments;” (Prov. 3:1). Just as David learned through his mistakes the importance of obedience, Jesus also wants you to be obedient to Him.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">If you love Jesus, show it through your obedience to Him and His Word</span>. Many Christians correctly point out that Jesus’ work on the cross made any further acts of obedience unnecessary to achieve salvation (Gal. 2:21). Obedience is instead a voluntary act that shows that you are sanctified and set apart for Him. Jesus is the great “I AM” who gave Moses the Ten Commandments (Jo. 8:58; Ex. 3:14). He warned: “If you love Me, you will keep My commandments.” (Jo. 14:15). “He who has My commandments and keeps them is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will disclose Myself to him.” (Jo. 14:21). “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our abode with him.” (Jo. 14:23). “If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love.” (Jo. 15:10). “By this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.” (1 Jo. 2:3). If you claim to love Jesus, you cannot openly disobey His Ten Commandments.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Be faithful because God is faithful to you</span>. David’s faith led to his obedience, even though he hated confronting his wayward sons. In response to God’s faithfulness, He also wants you to be faithful as well. “for we walk by faith, not by sight—” (2 Cor. 5:7). “A faithful man will abound with blessings, . . .” (Prov. 28:20(a)). “But the goal of our instruction is love from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.” (1 Tim. 1:5). “but holding to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.” (1 Tim. 3:9). Because God is faithful to keep His promises to you, respond by being faithful to Him.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">In response to David’s faithfulness, God extended Solomon’s power</span>. In response to David’s obedience, Benaiah prophetically proclaimed that Solomon’s reign would extend in power beyond that of David: “<em>make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David!</em>”’ (1 Kgs. 1:37). God later fulfilled His promise by making Solomon’s kingdom the greatest in wealth, power, and influence that Israel would ever experience.</p></li>

<p>5. <span class="underline">Spirit-led: God’s Leaders Should Always be Led by the Holy Spirit</span>. 1 Kgs. 1:38-40.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Solomon is anointed God’s next king, and the people celebrate</span>. Just as David was faithful to keep his vows, the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah were faithful to keep their vows in anointing Solomon: “<sup>38<em> </em></sup><em>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule, and brought him to Gihon. <sup>39 </sup>Zadok the priest then took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, “Long live King Solomon!” <sup>40 </sup>All the people went up after him, and the people were playing on flutes and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth shook at their noise</em>.” (1 Kgs. 1:38-40). Benaiah led the Cherethites and the Pelethites (2 Sam. 8:18). The Cherethites and the Pelethites were gentiles who faithfully served under David. The priest anointed Solomon in the tent that David set up to house the Ark of the Covenant (2 Sam. 6:17; 1 Chr. 15:1). By submitting to the anointing through oil at the altar, Solomon demonstrated his willingness to be led by the Holy Spirit as king. In response, the people celebrated. Because God was with him, he gained the support of all the people of Israel: “Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father; and he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.” (1 Chr. 29:23).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Be anointed with the Spirit</span>. Oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit (1 Sam. 16:13). Samuel previously used oil to anoint Saul as king (1 Sam. 10:1). He also used oil to anoint David as king (1 Sam. 16:13). Moses also poured oil onto Aaron’s head to consecrate Him. “Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him.” (Lev. 8:12). “Then you shall take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him.” (Ex. 29:7). When Christ began His ministry, He was dunked into the Jordan river (Matt. 3:13-15). The oil being poured onto the heads of kings and priests symbolized the complete emersion of the Spirit, like a baptism. Although human hands applied the oil, it was God who then anointed these leaders: “I have found David My servant; with My holy oil I have anointed him,” (Ps. 89:20). Believers should also be anointed by the Spirit in all that they do: “But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.” (1 Jo. 2:20). “Now He who establishes us with you in Christ and anointed us is God,” (1 Cor. 1:21). “For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” (Ro. 8:14). Are your actions in life anointed?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Like David, Jesus was filled the Holy Spirit</span>. Isaiah also prophesized that the Messiah would be filled with the Holy Spirit. “The Spirit of the LORD will rest on Him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.” (Is. 11:2). Jesus fulfilled this prophesy: “John testified saying, ‘I have seen the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He remained upon Him.’” (Jo. 1:32; Matt. 3:16; Mk. 1:10; Lk. 3:22). He also promises to fill you with the Holy Spirit to allow you to also do mighty things for Him (Jo. 14:16; 15:26; Acts 1:4; 5:32). With His Spirit, will you act boldly in the Spirit for the Kingdom of Heaven?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Solomon’s entrance on David’s mule symbolized his right to succeed David</span>. Each of David’s sons had a mule (Sam. 13:29). A mule is a crossbred animal, and God’s law prohibited the crossbreeding of animals (Lev. 19:19). Thus, any mule was imported. Many believe that they were used as symbols of royalty, despite God’s prohibition on crossbreeding. By having Solomon ride into Jerusalem on David’s mule (1 Kgs. 1:33, 38), David symbolized that Solomon was David’s successor.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Solomon’s entrance on a mule foreshadowed Jesus</span>. Solomon’s entrance on a mule foreshadowed Jesus. Yet, because Jesus came to fulfill the law, the prophet Zechariah stated that the Messiah would enter in Jerusalem on a donkey, not a mule which was prohibited under God’s law: “Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; He is just and endowed with salvation, humble, and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt, the foal of a donkey.” (Zech. 9:9). Jesus later fulfilled this prophesy: “Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, seated on a donkey’s colt.” (Jo. 12:15; Matt. 21:5).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6. <span class="underline">God-Fearing: God’s Leaders Should Fear Him by Hating Evil</span>. 1 Kgs. 1:41-50.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Adonijah and his coconspirators learn of Solomon’s anointing and are filled with fear</span>. After discovering that David had selected Solomon to become the next king, Adonijah and those who sided with him became filled with fear: “<sup>41 </sup><em>Now Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished eating. When Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, ‘Why is the city making such an uproar?’ <sup>42 </sup>While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. Then Adonijah said, ‘Come in, for you are a valiant man and bring good news.’ <sup>43 </sup>But Jonathan replied to Adonijah, ‘No! Our lord King David has made Solomon king. <sup>44 </sup>The king has also sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites; and they have made him ride on the king’s mule. <sup>45 </sup>Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon, and they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise which you have heard. <sup>46 </sup>Besides, Solomon has even taken his seat on the throne of the kingdom. <sup>47 </sup>Moreover, the king’s servants came to bless our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon better than your name and his throne greater than your throne!’ And the king bowed himself on the bed. <sup>48 </sup>The king has also said thus, ‘Blessed be the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, who has granted one to sit on my throne today while my own eyes see it.’ <sup>49 </sup>Then all the guests of Adonijah were terrified; and they arose and each went on his way. <sup>50 </sup>And Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, and he arose, went and took hold of the horns of the altar</em>.” (1 Kgs. 1:41-50). The trumpet for Solomon sounded before the feast for Adonijah was completed. Jonathan, the son of the priest Abiathar, had previously acted as one of David’s messengers (2 Sam. 15:36; 17:17). Things happened so fast that Solomon was on the throne before they could react. All of the traitors were filled with fear. Adonijah reacted in fear by placing his hands on the horns of the altar. This was a place of refuge for a person to be placed under God’s protection. Yet, it existed for people who committed unintentional crimes (Ex. 21:12-14; 1 Kgs. 2:28-34). Adonijah lived under the world’s standards. Thus, he expected Solomon to kill him the same way he most likely planned to kill Solomon.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God will humble those who exalt themselves</span>. Adonijah was abased because he exalted himself before God: “Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.” (Matt. 23:12). “For not from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert comes exaltation; But God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another.” (Ps. 75:6). “When you are cast down, you will speak with confidence, and the humble person He will save.” (Job 22:29). “But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, ‘God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.’” (Jam. 4:6). If you see yourself as better than the sinners around you, you also need to purge your pride.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">God will also judge those who live governed by pride and covetousness</span>. Like</strong> Adonijah<strong>, Satan was also blessed with great beauty and power as one of God’s most important angels. Like</strong> Adonijah<strong>, his pride also caused him to covet God’s power.</strong> Like Adonijah, Satan also desires to rule over mankind. “But you said in your heart, ‘I will ascend to heaven; I will raise my throne above the stars of God, and I will sit on the mount of assembly in the recesses of the north. <sup>14</sup> ‘I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.’” (Is. 14:13-14). Like Satan and Adonijah, Korah also rebelled against Moses in the wilderness because he was prideful as the nation’s worship leader. He was able to start a rebellion because he found 250 “men of renown” who demanded that Moses share power (Nu. 16:2). <strong>Yet, the pride that causes a person to feel entitled to power can ultimately lead to destruction: “</strong>Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before stumbling.<strong>” (Prov. 16:18).</strong> Those who rebel out of coveting also violate <strong>God’s Tenth Commandment (</strong>Ex. 20:17; Dt. 5:21). For the unsaved, “coveting” also disqualifies a person from heaven (1 Cor. 6:10; Eph. 5:3-6). The covetous leader will also feel torment. A person who covets can never satisfy their covetousness by giving into their desires (Hab. 2:5). A covetous leader will never feel satisfied and will inevitably lust after more power. If you feel pride in your accomplishments or in your looks, repent of those feelings. They may be the fuel that causes rebellion in your heart.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">God never approves of rebellion against His appointed leaders</span>. If</strong> Adonijah <strong>thought that he could sanction his rebellion before God through either sacrifices or the endorsement of the elites, he was mistaken.</strong> Peter says that those who “despise authority” are “corrupt.” (2 Pet. 2:10). <strong>God further considers rebellion to be one of the worst types of evils. “</strong>For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and insubordination is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, He has also rejected you from being king.” (1 Sam. 15:23). He warns that you are not to speak ill of His appointed leaders: “Do not touch My anointed ones, and do My prophets no harm.” (Ps. 105:15). When you have contempt toward His leaders, it is equivalent in the Bible to having contempt toward Him “Moses said, ‘ . . . Your grumblings are not against us but against the LORD.”’ (Ex. 16:8(b), 8; 1 Sam. 8:7). “Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.” (Ro. 13:1-2). “By me kings reign, and rulers decree justice.” (Prov. 8:15). “Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good deed,” (Titus 3:1). Unless a government practices evil, like the Nazis in World War II, rebellion is never allowed. Change should come peaceably through voting and through prayer.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Fear God by hating evil</span>. Solomon later revealed that: “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7; 9:10). “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; a good understanding have all those who do His commandments; His praise endures forever.” (Ps. 111:10). This did not mean that Solomon’s wayward brothers, like Amnon, <strong>Absalom,</strong> and Adonijah, needed to fear the arbitrary wrath of God. Instead, they needed to fear God by hating that which was evil: “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; . . .” (Prov. 8:13). If you are tolerating or embracing evil things in your life, the fear of God is missing in your life as well.</p></li>

<li><p><span class="underline">As his first act as king, Solomon grants Adonijah mercy</span>. As a man filled with the Holy Spirit, Solomon’s first act was to grant Adonijah a conditional pardon: “<sup>51 </sup><em>Now it was told Solomon, saying, “Behold, Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.’” <sup>52 </sup>Solomon said, “If he is a worthy man, not one of his hairs will fall to the ground; but if wickedness is found in him, he will die.” <sup>53 </sup>So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, ‘Go to your house</em>.’” (1 Kgs. 1:51-53). If Solomon had acted like a worldly king, he would have immediately killed Adonijah. Yet, as a Spirit-led leader, Solomon showed mercy and grace (Mic. 6:8). Yet, Solomon’s mercy was conditional upon Adonijah’s good behavior by ending his quest for power (1 Kgs. 1:52). Adonijah would later take Solomon’s mercy as a license to sin further. This would sadly result in his death (1 Kgs. 2:13-25).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Forgive those who persecute you</span>. Like Solomon, you should forgive those who hurt you: “A man’s discretion makes him slow to anger, and it is his glory to overlook a transgression.” (Prov. 19:11). “Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.” (Eph. 4:32). “For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” (Matt. 6:14). “bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.” (Col. 3:13). Have you forgiven those who have harmed you?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Forgive and show love to others as God has done for you</span>. Just as God forgave you and loved you, you should do the same to others: “For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” (Matt. 6:14). “Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.” (Eph. 4:32.) “bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone; just as the Lord forgave you, so also should you.” (Col. 3:13). “A man’s discretion makes him slow to anger, And it is his glory to overlook a transgression.” (Prov. 19:11). “You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself; I am the LORD.” (Lev. 19:18). “Do not say, ‘I will repay evil’; wait for the LORD, and He will save you.” (Prov. 20:22). “Do not say, ‘Thus I shall do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work.’” (Prov. 24:29). “But I say to you, do not resist an evil person; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.” (Matt. 5:39; Lk. 6:29). “Never pay back evil for evil to anyone. Respect what is right in the sight of all men.” (Ro. 12:17). “Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is written, ‘vengeance is mine, I will repay’ says the Lord.” (Ro. 12:19). Have you forgiven and shown love to your enemies?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Mercy is given to whom it is shown</span>. Adonijah demanded mercy when he was unwilling to show mercy to his brother. Just as God shows you mercy, He wants you to show mercy to others. “Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.” (Lk. 6:36). “Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.” (Matt. 5:7). “Do not judge, and you will not be judged; and do not condemn, and you will not be condemned; pardon, and you will be pardoned.” (Lk. 6:37). “Do not judge so that you will not be judged. For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.” (Matt. 7:1-2; Prov. 19:11). “Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.” (Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:13). Are you merciful to your enemies? Will you show mercy even if you have nothing worldly to gain for it?</p></li>
