<p>Genesis 32: Seven Lessons on Spiritual Transformation from Jacob’s Transformation</p>
<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span>: Looking at Jacob’s life until this point, it would be hard to find a single reason for God to have selected him to be the future father of the nation of Israel. He cheated his brother out of his birthright at a time when his brother was hungry. He defrauded his father and brother by tricking Isaac into believing that he was Esau when Isaac sought to bless Esau. He fled from the Promised Land instead of trusting God. He committed acts of polygamy by taking on four wives. He created jealousy and strife amongst his wives and children. Out of a covetous desire for wealth, he used superstition to try to build up his wealth at Laban’s expense. He gossiped against Laban and turned his daughters against him. He further failed to forgive Laban for Laban’s acts of deceit against him. He was also prideful when Laban confronted him. If a committee of humans were to select the future father of the nation of Israel, Jacob would have long ago been cut from the list. Yet, God sees people for the transformed believers that they will one day become, not as the sinners that they may be in the present. Here, upon his return to the Promised Land, Jacob’s transformation finally began. His life, guided by the flesh, finally gave way to the life guided by the Spirit. Here, Jacob met the pre-incarnate Jesus, and Jesus transformed Jacob by renaming him “Israel”. From Jesus’ transformation of Jacob, God reveals seven lessons on your transformation through faith in Jesus. These include: (1) forgiveness for your enemies; (2) trust in God; (3) repentance; (4) restitution for those you have wronged; (5) dependence upon God; (6) faith in Jesus; and (7) a desire to know and have fellowship with Him.</p>
<p><span class="underline">First</span>, Jacob forgave his brother and sent a messenger to seek his brother’s forgiveness as well. From this, God reveals that your transformation should begin by forgiving others who have hurt you. <span class="underline">Second</span>, Esau responded to Jacob’s good will offer by sending 400 men, an ominous sign. Jacob had no hope of victory in conflict on his own. He was forced to trust in God alone for his deliverance. Your transformation also requires that you trust in God alone for your deliverance. <span class="underline">Third</span>, for the first time in his life, Jacob approached God in prayer with a humble and contrite heart. He recognized that he was not worthy of God’s help. From this example, God also wants you to confess and repent of your sins to Him. <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, prompted by the Spirit, Jacob sent peace offerings of flocks of animals as restitution for his many wrongs against Esau. From this, God reveals that a transformed believer does more than merely apologize. He or she should also restore anyone that the person has harmed. <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, Jacob then wrestled with a pre-incarnate appearance of Jesus. Jesus made Jacob strong by making him weak and dependent upon Him. From this, God reveals that a transformed believer is dependent on Him. <span class="underline">Sixth</span>, without knowing the blessings that Jesus had to offer, Jacob showed faith by seeking out His blessings. Jesus rewarded Jacob by renaming him Israel. From this, God reveals that your transformation requires faith in seeking the blessings that comes only through Jesus. Like Jacob, Jesus will also reward your faith by renaming you in heaven. <span class="underline">Finally</span>, Jacob (now Israel) showed his transformed state by seeking to know Jesus’ good name. From this, God reveals that a transformed believer in Christ seeks out fellowship with Christ by desiring to know Him better.</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">Forgiveness: Your Transformation Begins with Forgiving Your Enemies</span>. Gen. 32:1-5.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jacob’s desire for peace and forgiveness from his brother</span>. During Jacob’s final encounter with Laban, Jacob revealed that he carried 20 years of resentment. At that point, Jacob was not yet a transformed man. Yet, as he approached his brother Esau, Jacob had no anger against his brother for threatening to kill him. His transformation began with his spirit of forgiveness: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Now as Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him. <sup>2 </sup>Jacob said when he saw them, ‘This is God’s camp.’ So he named that place Mahanaim. <sup>3 </sup>Then Jacob sent messengers before him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. <sup>4 </sup>He also commanded them saying, ‘Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: ‘Thus says your servant Jacob, ‘I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now; <sup>5 </sup>I have oxen and donkeys and flocks and male and female servants; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight</em>.’’’ (Gen. 32:1-5). Esau had previously threatened to kill Jacob: “The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” (Gen. 27:41(b)). Rebekah told Jacob to flee to Laban in Haran for a “few days” until she sent a message that it was safe to return: “Stay with him a few days, until your brother’s fury subsides,” (Gen. 27:44). Yet, Esau’s fury never subsided. Rebekah also never sent for Jacob to return home. He then spent 20 years of his life hiding from his brother’s wrath. He also suffered greatly during his exile. The Jacob of the flesh would have felt bitterness against Esau. Yet, the transformed Jacob forgave his brother. He also sought his brother’s forgiveness. As Jacob walked by the Spirit, he now also enjoyed the protection of angels.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Forgive others just as God forgave you</span>. One of Christ’s last seven statements before His death was the following prayer: “Father forgive them for they known not what they do.” (Lk. 23:34). He did this as an example for believers to follow. God expects every believer to forgive those who have caused them harm. “Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.” (Eph. 4:32). “[O]n the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, otherwise such a one might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.” (2 Cor. 2:7). “For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.” (Matt. 6:14). If someone repeatedly sins against you, Jesus says that you must forgive that person “up to seventy times seven” times (Matt. 18:22). If a believer does not forgive another believer, God will not forgive the believer (Matt. 18:35). Is there anyone who you need to forgive?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Be kind to your enemies to win them over</span>. Instead of lashing out in anger as he did with Laban, Jacob used kind words to win over his estranged brother: “By forbearance a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.” (Prov. 25:15). “A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.” (Prov. 15:1). “A hot-tempered man stirs up strife, but the slow to anger calms a dispute.” (Prov. 15:18). “Then they spoke to him, saying, ‘If you will be a servant to this people today, and will serve them and grant them their petition, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants forever.’” (1 Kgs. 12:7; 2 Chr. 10:7). If someone is angry at you, do you use kindness to win them over?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <span class="underline">Trust: Your Transformation Requires Trust in God’s Deliverance</span>. Gen. 32:6-8.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jacob’s fear in facing Esau on his own</span>. Unlike Jacob, Esau was not a transformed believer. He was still a man of the flesh. Jacob could not face his enemy on his own. He needed to trust God: “<sup>6 </sup><em>The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, ‘We came to your brother Esau, and furthermore he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.’ <sup>7 </sup>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and the herds and the camels, into two companies; <sup>8 </sup>for he said, ‘If Esau comes to the one company and attacks it, then the company which is left will escape</em>.’” (Gen. 32:6-8). Esau later arrived with 400 men (Gen. 33:1). In the past, Jacob escaped every danger in his life with through deception. He also previously tried to bargain with God by conditioning his promise to tithe on God’s provision (Gen. 28:20-22). Yet, He could not manipulate or deceive Esau as he had done in the past. There also was no way that he could fight 400 men on his own. Nor could he flee with his children and livestock. He further had nothing to bargain with for God to protect Him. He could only survive by trusting God to deliver him. Yet, by dividing his people into two groups, he showed that he did not yet fully trust God.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God can also send angels to protect you from evil</span>. Even though Jacob was unable to defend himself, God had just given him a sign from the angels to encourage him. Jacob further camped next to the angels for protection. The name he selected for the place “Mahanaim”, translates as “two camps.” (Gen. 32:1-2). God showed Jacob that he had no reason to fear. The angels would protect him from his brother’s wrath. Four hundred years later, God again used an angel to reassure the Jews that He would protect them during their similar return journey to the Promised Land: “The angel of God, who had been going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.” (Ex. 14:19). “But when we cried out to the LORD, He heard our voice and sent an angel and brought us out from Egypt; now behold, we are at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.” (Nu. 20:16). God also promises that His angel will encamp around those who fear Him: “The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and rescues them.” (Ps. 34:7). “For He will give His angels charge concerning you, to guard you in all your ways.” (Ps. 91:11). For example, an angel protected <strong>Daniel in the lion’s den:</strong> “My God sent His angel and shut the lions’ mouths and they have not harmed me, inasmuch as I was found innocent before Him; and also toward you, O king, I have committed no crime.” (Dan. 6:22). Angels also ministered to Jesus and Peter: “Then the devil left Him; and behold, angels came and began to minister to Him.” (Matt. 4:11; Mk. 1:13; Lk. 22:43). “When Peter came to himself, he said, ‘Now I know for sure that the Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.”’ (Acts 12:11). Jesus has more than “12 legion of angels” at His disposal to help you (Matt. 26:53). “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to render service for the sake of those who will inherit salvation?” (Heb. 1:14). Most believers will never know that angels are protecting them. For example, Elisha’s servant had no idea that angels were protecting him until Elisha prayed for God to open his eyes: “So he answered, ‘Do not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.’ Then Elisha prayed and said, ‘O LORD, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.’ And the LORD opened the servant’s eyes and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.” (2 Kgs. 6:16-17). Do you trust that His angels will also protect you?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God tests you to show you where your faith is lacking or where your heart is evil</span>. God’s angels could have struck down Esau’s 400 men. Or, they could have struck them with blindness, like they did in Sodom. The angels instead remained behind the scenes to allow God to test Jacob’s heart. God showed Jacob that he needed God to deliver him. God will also test you. He tests you to show you where your heart is evil (Jer. 17:9). He also tests you to show you where your faith is lacking. When He does, rejoice in knowing that His testing is designed to build up your faith: “Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials,” (Jam. 1:2). God cannot tempt you (Ja. 1:13-14). He does, however, test you: “I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, even to give to each man according to his ways, according to the results of his deeds.” (Jer. 17:10; 20:12). David was a sinner. Yet, he invited God to search his heart to expose his sins (Ps. 139:23). His openness to learning from his sins is what made him a man after God’s heart (Acts 13:22). Are you inviting God to test your heart?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Fear is <strong>f</strong>alse <strong>e</strong>vidence <strong>a</strong>ppearing <strong>r</strong>eal</span>. Trust and fear are reoccurring themes in the Torah. Abraham feared Pharaoh and Abimelech. Isaac feared a different Abimelech. Jacob feared Esau and later Laban. The Jews later feared their Egyptian slave masters. They also feared the Canaanites when they (like Jacob) tried to make their way back to the Promised Land. In all these cases, the patriarchs and the Jews were called upon to trust God and not to fear their enemies. “The fear of man brings a snare. But he who trusts in the Lord will be exalted.” (Prov. 29:25). “Trust in the LORD with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding.” (Prov. 3:5). “casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you.” (1 Pet. 5:7). The Lord is the only thing that you are to fear (Prov. 1:7). And the fear of the Lord is hating evil (Prov. 8:12). Do you fear God or evil people?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3. <span class="underline">Repentance: Transformation Requires Your Confession of Your Sins</span>. Gen. 32:9-12.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jacob’s humility and his contrite heart in approaching God</span>. Jacob had never before apologized or acted with humility. Yet, as a transformed believer, he approached God with a humble and contrite spirit for protection: “<sup>9 </sup><em>Jacob said, ‘O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, who said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your relatives, and I will prosper you,’ <sup>10 </sup> I am unworthy of all the lovingkindness and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant; for with my staff only I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two companies. <sup>11 </sup>Deliver me, I pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, that he will come and attack me and the mothers with the children. <sup>12 </sup>For You said, ‘I will surely prosper you and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which is too great to be numbered</em>.’’” (Gen. 32:9-12). This was Jacob’s first recorded prayer in the Bible. It lacked the sophistication of a prayer warrior. Yet, it was a start. He began by invoking God’s prior command for Jacob to return home (Gen. 31:3, 13). This included God’s promise 20 years earlier to prosper him (Gen. 28:13-15). God prompted Jacob to repeat His promises because faith comes through hearing the Word. “So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.” (Ro. 10:17). When his heart was ready, Jacob then did something he had never done previously. He pleaded to God for protection from the humility of an unworthy sinner (Gen. 32:10-11).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Let God bring you into the wilderness to show the sins in your heart</span>. God searches our hearts and tests our minds (Jer. 17:10; Ex. 20:20). In Hosea 2:14, God says “Therefore, behold, I will allure her, Bring her into the wilderness and speak kindly to her.” When we are tested, we frequently find that our hearts are wicked, and we are in need of repentance (Jer. 17:9). Sometimes our life is so busy that we can’t hear God’s voice and direction for us. Sometimes, He must pull us into the wilderness before we will finally listen to Him. The last time you found yourself in the wilderness because of your sin, what did you find when He showed you the sin in your heart? Did you repent?</p>
<p>7. <span class="underline">God Will Always Provide For You During Your Journey</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God forces us to depend upon Him in the wilderness</span>. Every good and perfect thing in our lives comes from above (Jam. 1:17). In the wilderness, we are forced to face this fact. In our busy lives, this is not always the case. As Moses warned: “you may say in your heart, ‘my power and my strength of my hand made me this wealth.” (Dt. 8:17). God may humble you in the wilderness to rid you of such beliefs. For those who love Him and are called according to His purpose, even time in the wilderness can be a good thing (Rom. 8:28). We should rejoice for any struggle that draws you closer to Him.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God provides for us in the wilderness</span>. Even if you wind up in a wilderness, the book of Numbers teaches us that God cares for us there (Hos. 13:5). Through Christ, He provided manna and water in the desert (Matt. 4:4; Jo. 6:33-35). He was also guiding the Jews by a visible pillar of light (Ex. 13:21-22; 14:19). He even protected their feet from swelling (Dt. 8:4). Jesus does not change (Heb. 13:8). We also need not worry about our provisions when we find ourselves in the wilderness of life: “But seek first the kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.” (Matt. 6:33).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God will never forsake us in the wilderness</span>. Even when we find ourselves in the wilderness because of our sins, we can rejoice that God will never leave us nor forsake us. He cared for the Jews, even when they rebelled against Him. The same is true with us as well: “I will never desert you, nor will I forsake you.” (Heb. 13:5; Dt. 31:6).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Give thanks by being a light to others</span>. Once you realize all that God has done for you in your wilderness, hopefully you will be motivated to serve Him (Rom. 12:1). The light that once guided the Jews now resides in you: “You are the light of the world.” (Matt. 5:14). Don’t hide His light and use your gifts for yourself (Matt. 5:15). Instead, let His light inside of you guide others to help them out of the wilderness and into God’s eternal Promised Land (Matt. 5:16). He also wants you to help to make disciples of all the nations of the Earth (Matt. 28:19-20).</p></li>
</ul>
