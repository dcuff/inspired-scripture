<p>Lev. 23:33-44; Nu. 29:12-40: How Christians Should Observe <em>Sukkot,</em> the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">Recognizing the Shadow of Christ in God’s Seven Holy Days.</span></p>
<p><span class="underline"></span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">All seven of the holy days on God’s calendar foreshadow Christ</span>. God’s holy days revealed the “shadows” of Christ (Col. 2:17). The “holy convocations” or “<em>miqras</em>” can also be translated as “rehearsals” (Lev. 23:2). With the first four holy days, the Jews unknowingly rehearsed for the Messiah’s arrival. With the last three days, we rehearse for His return.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">Passover</span>. Christ was the Passover lamb who died for us to allow judgment to “pass over” us (Isa. 53:7; Jo. 1:29; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). This day (“Good Friday”) is a day to stop and remember the terrible sacrifice that Christ paid for you so that death would pass you over.</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">The Feast of Unleavened Bread</span>. During this feast, Jesus was in the grave. Through Christ, we are freed from our sins, the “leaven” in our lives (1 Cor. 5:7; 6:13-20). This is the day to flee from the sins of your old lives the way that the Jews fled from theirs in Egypt.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">The Feast of First Fruits</span>. On this day (“Resurrection Sunday”), Jesus rose from the grave and became the “first fruits” of those who were once dead (1 Cor. 15:20). This is a day to give thanks to Him and offer the first fruits of your life as a “living sacrifice.” (Rom. 12:1).</p>
<p>(4) <span class="underline">The Feast of Weeks</span>. On this day, God revealed His will for us by pouring out the Holy Spirit unto His believers (“Pentecost”) (Acts 2:3). This is a day to give thanks for the Holy Spirit and to discern God’s will for you through reading the Word and through prayer.</p>
<p>(5) <em><span class="underline">Rosh HaShanah</span></em>. <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> is God’s New Years’ Day. It is celebrated by the blowing of trumpets (Lev. 23:24-25). <em>Rosh HaShanah</em> was celebrated over two days because no one knew the exact date that it began. Some believe that this foreshadows the rapture, the next event on the Christian calendar. Like <em>Rosh HaShanah,</em> the rapture will be preceded by the blowing of a loud trumpet (Matt. 24:31; 1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thess. 4:16-17). Yet, no one knows the exact day or hour of His return (Matt. 24:36; Mk. 13:32). This is a day to renew yourself, make your vows to God for the year to come, to study the Word, and to meditate about Jesus’ return. Yet, we should live every day being ready for His return.</p>
<p>(6) <span class="underline"><em>Yom Kippur</em>, the Day of Atonement</span>. <em>Yom Kippur</em> is the day of atonement for sin (Lev. 23:26-32). It was a somber time for repentance and prayer for the sins of the nation. Those who failed to repent would face God’s judgment. This foreshadows the day of wrath when Jesus will come to judge the nations (Joel 2:1; Rev. 8-9). This is a day to repent of your sins, give thanks for what He did for you, and to pray and fast for the nations to repent.</p>
<p>(7) <span class="underline"><em>Sukkot,</em> the Feast of Tabernacles or Booths</span>. <em>Sukkot</em> was the last of God’s holy days. It was the most joyful of all. It celebrated when God came to dwell or “tabernacle” amongst us. It also foreshadowed both when Christ dwelled with us and when He will again “tabernacle” with us during His 1,000-year reign on Earth. This Feast celebrates God. It is a “<em>perpetual statute throughout your generation</em>. . . ” (Lev. 23:41). If you celebrate it, “your God will <strong>bless</strong> you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands. . .” (Dt. 16:15).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. <span class="underline">The Seven Reasons to Celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles/ Booths / “Ingathering” or <em>Sukkot</em>.</span> Ex. 23:16; 25:8; 34:22; 29:44-45; Lev. 23:33-43; Nu. 29:12-40; Dt. 16:13-17; 31:10-13; Zech. 14:16-19; John 7.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">Celebrate that Jesus once dwelt amongst us</span>. This festival lasted eight days and began on the 15th day of the seventh month of the religious calendar or the first month of the civil calendar (Lev. 23:39). This celebrated when the Jews made a “<em>sukkot</em>” or tabernacle for God to dwell with the Jews: “Let them construct a sanctuary for Me, that I may <em>dwell</em> (‘tabernacle’) among them.” (Ex. 25:8). To observe the time when God dwelt in a temporary structure, the Jews build small booths or tents to dwell in for one week. Few Christians observe this holy day because we are freed from any legal obligation to do so (Col. 2:16-17). Yet, out of devotion and not obligation, we also have reason to celebrate that God dwelt with us. He promises to bless all your labors if you do so (Dt. 16:15).</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">Celebrate that Jesus delivered you from your bondage of sin</span>. “I will dwell among the sons of Israel . . . They shall know that I am the Lord their God <em>who brought them out of the land of Egypt,</em> that I might dwell among them; I am the Lord their God.” (Ex. 29:45-46). “You shall live in booths for seven days; all the native-born in Israel shall live in booths, so that your generations may know that I had the sons of Israel live in booths when <em>I brought them out from the land of Egypt</em>. I am the Lord your God.” (Lev. 23:42-43). Egypt was the land on bitter bondage (Ex. 1:11-22). We too were “once slaves on sin.” (Rom. 6:17). If you are thankful for being delivered from bondage, this is the appointed time to celebrate.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">Celebrate that Jesus provides food for you</span>. While the two prior holy days were times of renewal and repentance, this was a time of great celebration and joy: “You shall <em>celebrate</em> a feast to the Lord your God . . . <em>because the Lord will bless you</em> in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that you will be altogether <em>joyful</em>.” (Dt. 16:15-17). This was the last of three feasts where the Jews were required to come together and celebrate the harvests that God had provided (Ex. 34:23; Dt. 16:16). These included the celebration of the barely harvest during the feast of first fruits, the wheat harvest during the feast of weeks, and the fruit harvest during the feast of tabernacles. The feast of Tabernacles became known simply as “the Feast.” (Jo. 7:37). It was the greatest celebration of all. The Talmud states: “He who has not seen Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles does not know what rejoicing is.” In addition to celebrating the harvests in the promised land, the Jews celebrated that God provided manna in the desert (Ex. 16:31; Nu. 11:8-9). He even provided quail after they grumbled about their food (Ex. 16:1-8; Nu. 11:4-6, 32-33). He further protected the Jews’ feet from swelling (Dt. 8:4). Christ later revealed that He was the Manna that rained down from heaven (Matt. 4:4; Jo. 6:33-35). Just as Jesus cared for the Jews in the wilderness (Hos. 13:5), He cares for us. He provides all that we need (Matt. 6:25-34). He protects us on our journey from the evil one (Matt. 6:13). If you are thankful for all God’s provision and blessings in your life, this is the appointed time to celebrate it.</p>
<p>(4) <span class="underline">Celebrate that Jesus provides us with “living water” in the desert</span><em>.</em> During their time in the wilderness, God provided the Jews with their water. For example, God transformed the dirty waters of Marah to provide drinking water (Ex. 15:25-27). In addition, “[t]hey did not thirst when He led them through the deserts. He made the water flow out of the rock for them; <em>He split the rock and the water gushed forth</em>.” (Isa. 48:21; Nu. 20:2-12; Ps. 81:16; 106:41). Jesus was the Rock who gave the living water (1 Cor. 10:3-4). “Trust in the Lord forever, for we have <em>an everlasting Rock</em>.” (Isa. 26:4). During the Feast of Tabernacles, the Jews again celebrated that God gave them the water of life. The High Priest took a golden pitcher of water from the pool of Siloam and poured it into a basin at the altar of the Temple. The water then flowed back through a pipe to the Brook of Kidron (Talmud: Sukkah 4:9). This was done in conjunction with prayers for rain to allow there to again be crops in the land the following year. In connection with this ceremony, the Talmud states: “Why is the name of it called the Drawing Out of Water? Because of the pouring out of the Holy Spirit, according to what is said: ‘With joy shall ye draw out of the wells of salvation’” (Is. 12:3). This all foreshadowed Jesus. On the last day of this festival, He stepped forward and cried out: “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, from his innermost being will flow rivers of living water.” (Jo. 7:37-39). Unless we understand the context in which He made this statement, we may fail to fully appreciate its full meaning. If Jesus chose to reveal during “the Feast” that He was “the living water,” why don’t Christians acknowledge this day? If you are grateful for His living water of eternal life, this is the time that He appointed for us to celebrate it.</p>
<p>(5) <span class="underline">Celebrate that Jesus provides us with the light of the world</span>. During their time in the wilderness, God guided the people with a visible pillar of light (Ex. 13:21-22; 14:19). When they got to the Promised Land, they celebrated the light that God provided to them. From the second night of Tabernacles until the final day, the people gathered in the outer court of the Temple and lit oil lamps. The lights were to remind the people of the <em>Shekinah</em> glory that dwelt with the people in the Holy of Holies in the wilderness and later during King Solomon’s day. It was also to remind people that the <em>Shekinah</em> glory would return with the Messiah (Ez. 43:1-5). It was also in the context of “the Feast” that Jesus revealed that He is the real light of the world: “I am the Light of the world; he who follows Me will not walk in darkness, but will have the Light of life.” (Jo. 8:12). He guides us with His light today through the Word, which is “a lamp unto thy feet.” (Ps. 119:105). He also gives us light through the Holy Spirit (Jo. 14:26). The Jews were meant to also be a light to the rest of the world (Is. 42:6; 49:6). Today, any believer has this role (Matt 5:14; 1 Pet. 2:4-5). If you are grateful for the light that Jesus created for you, this is His appointed time to celebrate it.</p>
<p>(6) <span class="underline">Celebrate that we will one day be glorified in new “tabernacles” and dwell with God</span>. God’s <em>Shekinah</em> glory entered the tabernacle when it was complete (Ex. 40:34). The feast of Tabernacles celebrated this. God’s <em>Shekinah</em> glory entered Israel’s first Temple after Solomon dedicated it. Without coincidence, this also took place during the Feast of Tabernacles (2 Ch. 5:3; 7:1-4; 1 Kgs. 8; Ezra 3:1-4). Because of our sins, we were separated from God’s presence (Isa. 59:2). Even Moses could not be in the presence of God’s <em>Shekinah</em> glory (Ex. 40:35). Yet, because of Jesus’ death at the cross, we can now be directly in God’s presence. One day, we will be glorified in heaven with new bodies (Phil. 3:21). We “will see His face. . . [and] the Light of God (“<em>Shekinah</em> glory”) will illumine them forever and ever.” (Rev. 22:5). If you are excited about one day dwelling directly in God’s presence, the Feast of Tabernacles is God’s appointed time to celebrate this.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The third festival symbolizes the final stage of our walk with God</span>. This final stage of our walk, our “glorification” through Christ in heaven, is also represented by the three festivals. The feast of first fruits was the barley harvest. Barley doesn’t taste good, but it is nutritious. Jesus fed the masses with “five barley loaves.”  (Jo. 6:9). Even though they were not committed believers, their belief was enough for Jesus to instruct his disciples, “Gather up the fragments that remain, <strong>that nothing be lost.” (Jo. 6:12). As believers, even if they were not strong in their walk, they had overcome death through Christ. The second feast, the feast of weeks, was a wheat harvest. This was also</strong> Pentecost <strong>when the Holy Spirit came down (Acts 2:3). This stage represents a believer (</strong>the “wheat”) who has been “baptize[d] with the Holy Spirit and with fire” (Matt. 3:11-12). Fruit is the final harvest. It represents the fruit of the Spirit in a believer (Gal. 5:22-23). Alternatively, each of the three harvests represents a stage in a believer’s walk with God: (1) barley = our justification through Christ, (2) wheat = our sanctification by the Spirit, i.e. being set apart from the world, and (3) fruit = out glorification through Christ in heaven with new bodies and the fullness of the Spirit.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The final stage of your walk is also represented in the Tabernacle</span>. The three stages of your walk are also shown in the layout of the Tabernacle. There was the outer court yard where the sacrifices were made (Ex. 26-27). This is where you Jews justified by the blood of at the bronze altar (Ex. 27:1-8). There was then the Tent of Meeting. The priests went there to light both the incense and the Golden lampstand and to prepare the table of showbread (Ex. 25:23-40). This is where the Jews sanctified by the Holy Spirit, i.e. set apart for God. Finally, there was the Holy of Holies where the ark of the covenant was kept (Ex. 25:10-22). Only the High Priest could go there on <em>Yom Kippur</em>. This place represents the final stage of our walk when we will one day dwell with God and be glorified in His presence.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(7) <span class="underline">Celebrate that Jesus was the final and complete sacrifice</span>. Finally, we celebrate that Jesus was the one-time sacrifice that freed us from the obligation to sacrifice animals to have our sins forgiven (Heb. 10:14). During the Feast, the Jews made an offering by fire to the Lord (Lev. 23:37). Including two lambs that were normally sacrificed each day (Nu. 28:2), the burnt offering includes a staggering 215 expensive animal sacrifices: (1) 71 one-year old bulls without defect; (2) 15 rams without defect (3) 121 lambs without defect; and (4) eight goats without defect. In addition, the meal offerings included oil offerings, wine offerings, and 336 tenths of “ephahs” of fine flour (Nu. 29:12-39). If God was willing to accept the sacrifice of animals on our behalf, we have no reason to doubt Christ’s ability to atone for even the worst sinners (Heb. 9:14). If you are grateful that you no longer need to buy and sacrifice these expensive animals, this is God’s appointed time to celebrate that.</p>

<p>3. <span class="underline">Seven Facts Connecting Jesus’ Birth to the Feast of Tabernacles</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Christmas was most likely not Christ’s actual birthday</span>. The Bible does not say that Christ was born on Christmas. Most expert also agree that this was most likely not His real birthday. Why then do we celebrate His birthday on that date? In 324 A.D., Roman emperor Justinian recognized Christmas Day as Christ’s official birthday. The day was previously a pagan holiday. Emperor Justinian wanted to bring together the pagan peoples and the new Christian church for the same holiday. “December 25 in ancient Rome was the ‘Dies Natali Invictus,’ ‘the birthday of the unconquered…”’ It was also “the day of the winter solstice ...” (Werner Keller, <em><strong>The Bible as History</strong></em> p. 331).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The Weather on December 25<sup>th</sup></span>. It is possible that Jesus’ birthday by chance happened on a Pagan holiday. Yet, every other major event in Christ’s life fell on one of God’s holy days. Moreover, the weather and the Jewish customs about when animal flocks were to be in the field both strongly suggest that Christ was not born on December 25<sup>th</sup>. At the time of Jesus’ birth, there were “shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.” (Lk. 2:8). Meteorologists have recordings of the temperature at Hebron, near Bethlehem, at that time. “The temperature readings show over a period of three months that the incidence of frost is as follows: December -- 2.8 degrees; January -- 1.6 degrees; February ---0.1 degrees.. . . ” Thus,“[a]t Christmas-time Bethlehem [wa]s in the grip of frost, and in the Promised Land no cattle would have been in the fields in that temperature. The Talmud also states that the flocks were put out to grass in March and brought in again at the beginning of November (p. 331-332). Thus, it was both too cold and the wrong time of year for shepherds to be in the field. When then was Christ mostly likely born?</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">The Timing of John the Baptist’s Birth and Mary’s Conception</span>. Jesus’ mother Mary became pregnant when John the Baptist’s mother Elizabeth was six months pregnant (Lk. 1:26). We also know when Elizabeth conceived based upon what the Bible says that her husband Zacharias was doing at the time. Zacharias was a priest of the division of Abijah (Lk. 1:5; 1 Chr. 24:10). He received an announcement from God regarding the birth of John the Baptist while burning incense in preparation for Passover during the month <em>Sivan</em> (Lk. 1:5-25). The angel came to Mary during the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy (Lk. 1:26). Nine months later would put Jesus’ birth during the festival of <em>Sukkot</em> or during the Jewish month of <em>Tishrei.</em> (Chumney, <em>The Seven Festivals of the Messiah</em> (Treasure House 2003 p. 189). If Jesus was not born on the Feast of Tabernacles, God would not have given us such precise details regarding the timing of Mary’s conception. Moreover, for Christ’s birthday to fall on one of God’s seven holy days fits within the pattern of each major event in Christ’s life falling on one of God’s seven holy days. His birth should be no exception.</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">God “dwelling” With Us</span>. Isaiah predicted that the Messiah would be called Immanuel, which means “God with Us” (Is. 7:14).  John tells us that the Word (of God) became flesh and “dwelt <em>sukkat</em>” (or tabernacled) among us (Jo. 1:14).  Col. 2:9 states, “For in Him the entire fullness of God’s nature <em>dwells</em> bodily.” The very purpose of <em>Sukkat</em> was to celebrate when God came to dwell with His people (Ex. 25:8; 29:44-45). We celebrate Christ’s birthday to remember when Christ came to dwell or tabernacle with us.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">The Month of <em>Tishrei</em></span>. <em>Sukkot</em> took place during <em>Tishrei,</em> the first month on the civil calendar. <em>Nisan</em> was the first month of the religious calendar. We have both a physical and a spiritual birth. Jesus died on the first month of the religious calendar, <em>Nisan</em>. A logical pattern would exist for His birth to correspond with the first month of the civil calendar, <em>Tishrei</em>.</p>
<p>(4) <span class="underline">The Season of Joy and Rain</span>. Upon Jesus’ birth, the angel of the Lord told the shepherds that he brought “good news of great joy which will be for all the people.” (Lk. 2:10). <em>Sukkot</em> was the season of joy (Dt. 16:13-15). <em>Tishrei</em> was also the rainy season. Rain is a symbol of blessing, life, and God’s Word (Dt. 11:10-17; 32:1-3; 1 Ki. 18:41-46). The lack of rain is symbol of judgment (1 Kgs. 8:33-43). Hosea said that the Messiah would come like rain on the earth (Hos. 6:3). The Holy Spirit also later poured out like rain (Acts 2:1-8, 14-21).</p>
<p>(5) <span class="underline">The Manger</span>. Baby Jesus was laid in a manger (Lk. 2:12). The Greek work for manger “<em>phatn’e</em>” is also translated in the Bible as a “stall” (Lk. 13:15). The word <em>Sukkot</em> literally means “shelters, stables, booths, stalls, or huts.” Jacob is likewise said to have made a “booth” or “stall” for his animals while traveling to <em>Succoth</em> (Gen. 33:17). The people were to live in booths during <em>Sukkot</em>. Although His booth or stall was meant for animals, Jesus would have fulfilled the Law by being born in such a booth or stall.</p>
<p>(6) <span class="underline">The Lack of Lodging</span>. During the time of <em>Sukkot</em>, the Jews all had to travel to Jerusalem (Dt. 16:16). Bethlehem was only four miles from Jerusalem. There may have been no lodging available at the time because of the number of religious pilgrims in the area.</p>
<p>(7) <span class="underline">Sight of Jesus’ Star</span>. The wise men, possible rabbis living in Babylon, knew to come because they saw Jesus’ star in the east (Matt. 2:2). During <em>Sukkot</em>, they would be living outside in structures where they would see the stars at night.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Without condemnation, we can celebrate both Christ’s real and the “observed” birthday</span>. In 1643, the Puritans outlawed Christmas observances in England because they believed that the date had a pagan origin. Colonists in New England followed the English laws and also outlawed Christmas. But immigrants to the New World brought Christmas customs from many lands and the old festivities where soon restored. Armed with the truth, it might be tempting to become prideful and judge someone for observing Christ’s birthday on the wrong day. Yet, God is clear that we cannot be judged for deciding not to observe a holy day (Col. 2:16-17). We are under no legal obligation to celebrate Christ’s birth. Thus, we are not and cannot be judged for observing His birthday on the wrong date. As any parent knows, you celebrate a child’s birthday on both the child’s real birthday as a family and again on a date when other people are available. The Feast is Jesus’ real birthday. Christmas is the “observed date” for everyone else to come and celebrate again with us.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <span class="underline">Seven Things the Festival of Tabernacles Tells Us About the Millennial Reign.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The Millennial Reign</span>. The millennial reign will happen after the rapture and after the Day of Judgment. Jesus will dwell (“tabernacle”) with His believers for 1,000 years. Near the end of this period, the devil will be released from his jail and deceive God’s people. The devil, his angels, and the people who reject Christ will all then be judged (Rev. 20:1-15). Beyond this, most Christians presume that the Bible says nothing about the Millennial Reign. They presume this only if they haven’t studied the Old Testament.</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">During the Millennial Reign, nations of believers in Christ will be forgiven</span>. (the 70 bulls). If we exclude the eighth day the Feast which had a special meaning explained below, a total of 70 bulls were sacrificed during the week (see chart above). By rabbinic tradition, the 70 bulls represent a sacrifice for each of the original 70 nations that descended from Noah (Gen. 10) (Walter Riggans, <em>Numbers</em> (Westminster John Knox Press 1983) p. 216). During this time, the believers of the nations of the Earth will be forgiven of their past sins.</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">The redeemed Jews and Gentiles will gather together under Christ.</span> (the Grain Offering). As part of this Feast, the people were told to gather the “product of goodly trees.” (Lev. 23:40). The Feast of Tabernacles also foreshadows a day in which Jews and Gentiles worship God together in a new Jerusalem. Without coincidence, Zechariah foresaw that the nations of believers in the Messiah would come together to worship at Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles (Zech. 14:16-21). Thus, until the very end of the Millennial Reign, the divisions, the conflicts and the wars of the world will come to an end.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">During the Millennial Reign, the curses on the Earth will be lifted</span>. (the 98 lambs). If we exclude the lamb sacrifices for the eighth day the Feast and the two daily lambs that were normally sacrificed (Nu. 28:2), a total of 98 lambs were sacrificed over the holy week (see chart above). Some Jews claim that there are exactly 98 curses found in the Torah. These curses all date back to the original sin in Genesis, which cursed all of creation (Gen. 3:19; Rom. 5:14-19). These Jews assert that the 98 lambs lifted the 98 curses from Deuteronomy 28 (Riggans, <em>Numbers</em> p. 216). The New Testament tells us that it was Christ who lifted the curses (Gal. 2:10-13). The Bible also foretells of a time when the people will come together and live under God’s rule without the ravages of sin. The Earth will give bountifully. The animals will be docile (Isa. 65:25). The entire Earth will be blessed. Our bodies may also be physically changed. Today, the Holy Spirit dwells within us in our temporary bodies, which are like the temporary structures that the Jews built. In heaven, God has bodies ready for us that will not undergo corruption (Rom. 8:23; 1 Cor. 15:51-57; 2 Cor. 5:1-4). Because the Earth and the animals will be restored during the Millennial Reign, this suggests that the diseases, birth defects, and other ailments that we suffer from as a result of the original sin of Adam and Eve will be lifted during this time period as well.</p>
<p>(4) <span class="underline">During the Millennial Reign, God’s Shekinah Glory will glow on top of Mount Zion.</span> (the Oil). During the Millennial Reign, God will tabernacle with the redeemed on Earth again (Ez. 37:27-28). His <em>Shekinah</em> glory be will visible again (Isa. 60:1, 19; Zech. 2:5). At that time, Mountain Zion will have a cloud by day and a fire by night (Isa. 4:5-6).</p>
<p>(5) <span class="underline">Christ’s administration will be just</span>. (the two rams). The Feast included two daily ram sacrifices. The ram offering was a “trespass” offering for the people’s sins against the Lord (Lev. 5:14-19). It is a symbol of divine justice. A wrong must be paid to restore a victim. Two is also a number of confirmation. The two rams suggest a time of justice both in Jesus’ civil reign and His spiritual reign. Wrongdoers who seek God’s forgiveness will be forgiven (1 Jo. 1:9). Wrongdoers will be asked to restore persons that they have wronged through restitution (Lev. 5:15). The Bible’s laws will be followed. Finally, people will be asked to forgive others for their wrongs (Lk. 6:37; Matt. 6:14; Mk. 11:25).</p>
<p>(6) <span class="underline">Initially intense but declining fellowship with Christ</span>. (the drink offering). The sacrifices also included a drink offering. This symbolized communion with Christ (Mk. 14:24; Jo. 6:53). It also symbolized a life filled with joyful devotion (Phil. 2:17). At the beginning of the Millennial Reign, the number of sacrifices suggest more intense devotion than in any prior time in human history. Where the prior sacrifices ranged from one to at most three bull sacrifices in one day, the first day of the Feast had 13 bull sacrifices. This suggests a time of great singing, dancing, celebration, and devotion across the world. Imagine a religious revival being celebrated by every nation on Earth at the same time. Yet, the number 13 is not an even number or a number symbolizing order. Each day during the first seven days, the number of bull sacrifices decreases by one. By the seventh day (and the end of the Millennial Reign), the number of bull sacrifices has dropped to seven, almost half the intensity of worship from when the reign begins. At this point, Satan will be released from his prison (Rev. 20:7). He will deceive the nations and gather together armies “like the sand of the seashore” (Rev. 20:8). They will surround the “camp of the saints and the beloved city.” At that point, “fire came down from heaven and devoured them” (Rev. 20:9). All this will happen because people will grow complacent in their walk. If you have ever wondered how the people on the Millennial Reign could live under Christ directly and rebel, the answer can be summarized in two words - - declining worship. Only after the worship had faded due to the sin in people’s hearts will the devil be able deceive them. This should cause us to pause and ask how seriously we are taking our worship.</p>
<p>(7) <span class="underline">The final judgment of the wicked</span>. (the goats). During the Feast of Tabernacles, one goat was sacrificed each day (see chart above). The goats represented sin. During this Feast, the people were also told to gather their harvest or crops of the land (Lev. 23:39). This agricultural festival is also called the Festival of Ingathering (Ex. 23:16). A harvest is frequently used as a symbol for God’s judgment (Matt. 13:39; Hos. 6:11; Joel 3:13; Rev. 14:14-20). The wicked will not receive rain or blessings (Zech. 14:1-9, 16-18). Christ says that the goats or chaff (the non-believers) will be separated from the wheat (the sanctified believers) (Matt. 9:35-38; 25:31-46; Lk. 10:1-2; Jo. 4:35-38; Rev. 14:14-18). At the end of the Millennial Reign, the people who rebel against God will be judged (Rev. 20:9). The devil and his demons will be judged (Rev. 20:10). The people not written in the lamb’s book of life will then face judgment at the “great whter try to justify or ignore their sin? One tool available to God to correct an individual is to cause confusion or spiritual blindness: “The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will smite you with madness and with blindness and with bewilderment of heart; and you will grope at noon, as the blind man gropes in darkness, and you will not prosper in your ways; but you shall only be oppressed and robbed continually, with none to save you.” (Dt. 28:27-29; Ex. 10:21). “We grope along the wall like blind men, we grope like those who have no eyes; we stumble at midday as in the twilight, . . .” (Is. 59:10(a)). “By day they meet with darkness, and grope at noon as in the night.” (Job 5:14; 12:25; 38:15). “They wandered, blind, in the streets; . .” (Lam. 4:14(a); Amos 8:9). “The way of the wicked is like darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.” (Prov. 4:19). A person is blind to their sins when they can no longer see their sins. Does your brother or sister believe that their sinful actions are justified by the Bible? Does your brother or sister try to rationalize his or her actions? Have they stopped caring?</p>
<p>(d) <span class="underline">Practical Application. The failure to repent will lead to more serious pain.</span> God says that only “fools mock at sin . . .” (Prov. 14:9). A sinner can become “bound by the cords” of his or her “sin” if he or she does not repent (Prov. 5:22). In the same manner as a sinner returns to sin, a dog return to its vomit (2 Pet. 2:22). David at first did not feel remorseful after sending Bathsheba’s husband Uriah to his death. Yet, he later felt great sorrow when his sins were exposed and he suffered judgment for his actions. He showed that his scales had been removed when he invited God to search his heart for hidden sin: “Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me and know my anxious thoughts;” (Ps. 139:23).</p>
<p>(e) <span class="underline">Practical Application. Only God can open the eyes of the blind.</span> God alone can open the eyes of the sinner who is blinded by sin. “The LORD opens the eyes of the blind; the LORD raises up those who are bowed down; the LORD loves the righteous.” (Ps. 146:8; Ex. 4:11). Are you praying for God to lift any scales that might be blinding you to sin? Are you praying for the nation’s scales to be lifted?</p>

<p>6. <span class="underline">Diagnosing the Sin that Is Open, Contagious, and Dangerous.</span> Lev. 13:38-46.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) <span class="underline">Symptoms</span>: At this stage, (1) bright spots form on the skin; (2) a reddish-white infection appears in a bald area; and (3) there is a swelling of the infection. “<em>When a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, even white bright spots, then the priest shall look, and if the bright spots on the skin of their bodies are a faint white, it is eczema that has broken out on the skin; he is clean. Now if a man loses the hair of his head, he is bald; he is clean. If his head becomes bald at the front and sides, he is bald on the forehead; he is clean. But if on the bald head or the bald forehead, there occurs a reddish-white infection, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or on his bald forehead. Then the priest shall look at him; and if the swelling of the infection is reddish-white on his bald head or on his bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the body, he is a leprous man, he is unclean. The priest shall surely pronounce him unclean; his infection is on his head. As for the leper who has the infection, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall be uncovered, and he shall cover his mustache and cry, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’ He shall remain unclean all the days during which he has the infection; he is unclean. He shall live alone; his dwelling shall be outside the camp</em>.”’ (Lev. 13:38-46).</p>
<p>(b) <span class="underline">Treatment</span>: There was no treatment. At this stage, the leper had to tear his clothes, keep his hair uncovered and yell “unclean, unclean” as he approached anyone (Lev. 13:45).</p>
<p>(c) <span class="underline">Practical Application. An unrepentant sinner is a danger to others</span>. Many sinners seek the company of other sinners and are led further astray. Or, they bring others around them down in their own sin. For example, many who drink heavily or use drugs reinforce their bad habits by hanging out with others who drink heavily or use drugs. Likewise, many who are sexually promiscuous surround themselves with others who are also promiscuous. People who abuse their children also frequently create a vicious cycle whereby the children abuse their children. “Do not be deceived: ‘Bad company corrupts good morals.’” (1 Cor. 15:33). Sinners typically seek out the companionship of other sinners because “men love darkness.” (Jo. 3:19). Yet, these spiritually blind individuals will suffer confusion as the reasons for their misery remain a mystery to them. They lack a guiding light to be pulled out of darkness. Are you a light to those around you who are trapped in sin? (Matt. 5:14).</p>
<p>(d) <span class="underline">Practical Application: Unrepentant sin frequently leads to humiliation</span>. The loss of hair is a sign of ugly an sin, humiliation, and morning. “<em>instead of well-set hair, a plucked-out scalp</em>; . . .” (Isa. 3:24; 50:6; Jer. 7:29), When a sinner embraces evil, that person will eventually be vilified by others when their conduct is exposed. This is especially true of public figures: “You shall become a horror, a proverb, and a taunt among all the people where the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> drives you.” (Dt. 28:37), “I will make them a terror and an evil for all the kingdoms of the earth, as a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse in all places where I will scatter them.” (Jer. 24:9; 44:8; 15:4), “You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and a derision to those around us.” (Ps. 44:13; Is. 43:28; 2 Chron. 7:20; 1 Kgs. 9:7(b); Ezek. 5:15). Sometimes, sinners will still experience sorrow even after they repent. Although ridicule may be unavoidable, if you wish to avoid eternal punishment there is only one place to turn to if you desire that not a single hair on our head perish (Lk. 21:18).</p>
<p>(e) <span class="underline">Practical Application: Unrepentant sinners must be expelled to protect the Church</span>. Leprosy would run rampant if not isolated. Has the person become abusive to his or her spouse or children? Is the person a threat to others? Is the person spreading false doctrines within the church? What is the final step if a sinner refuses to repent? (Matt. 18:15-18).</p>
<p>(f) <span class="underline">Practical Application. There is always a chance to repent</span>. A sinner humiliated by hair loss could be cleaned if he did not sin again (Lev. 13:41). Believers also sometimes need to hit rock bottom before they repent. Thankfully, it is never too late to repent while a person is still alive (1 Jo. 1:9). If you know someone who has hit rock bottom, have you given them the hope that lies in Jesus alone to obtain forgiveness of sin?</p>

<p>7. <span class="underline">Diagnosing Sin In Someone’s Garments, i.e., Outward Acts</span>. Lev. 13:47-59.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) <span class="underline">Symptoms</span>: At this stage, (1) there is a greenish or reddish mark on the clothes; (2) the mark spreads; and (3) the mark will not go away after washing. “<em>When a garment has a mark of leprosy in it, whether it is a wool garment or a linen garment, whether in warp or woof, of linen or of wool, whether in leather or in any article made of leather, if the mark is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather, or in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is a leprous mark and shall be shown to the priest. Then the priest shall look at the mark and shall quarantine the article with the mark for seven days. He shall then look at the mark on the seventh day; if the mark has spread in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in the leather, whatever the purpose for which the leather is used, the mark is a leprous malignancy, it is unclean. So he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool or in linen, or any article of leather in which the mark occurs, for it is a leprous malignancy; it shall be burned in the fire. But if the priest shall look, and indeed the mark has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, then the priest shall order them to wash the thing in which the mark occurs and he shall quarantine it for seven more days. After the article with the mark has been washed, the priest shall again look, and if the mark has not changed its appearance, even though the mark has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire, whether an eating away has produced bareness on the top or on the front of it. Then if the priest looks, and if the mark has faded after it has been washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment or out of the leather, whether from the warp or from the woof; and if it appears again in the garment, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, it is an outbreak; the article with the mark shall be burned in the fire. The garment, whether the warp or the woof, or any article of leather from which the mark has departed when you washed it, it shall then be washed a second time and will be clean. This is the law for the mark of leprosy in a garment of wool or linen, whether in the warp or in the woof, or in any article of leather, for pronouncing it clean or unclean</em>.” (Lev. 13:47-59).</p>
<p>(b) <span class="underline">Treatment</span>: The clothing was quarantined for 14 days (Lev. 13:50, 54). If the garments cannot be washed clean (Lev. 13:55), they must be burned (Lev. 13:52, 55, 57).</p>
<p>(c) <span class="underline">Practical Application. The fruits of the unrighteous are infested with sin</span>. God correlates righteousness with our garments. When done without Jesus, our righteous acts are filthy rags: “<em>and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment</em>;. . ..” (Isa. 64:6). The fruit that comes from an unrepentant sinner’s life is evil is visible for all to see: “You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn <em>bushes</em> nor figs from thistles, are they?” (Matt. 7:17-19). Is the fruit of your life the fruit of the Spirit or of the flesh? (Gal. 5:19-23).</p>
<p>(d) <span class="underline">Practical Application. A sinner must burn his or her unrighteous acts</span>. Garments infected with sin had to be burned (Lev. 13:52, 55, 57). A sinner cannot hold onto the unclean things in his or her life after he or she repents. Your clothes must be white “all the time.” (Ecc. 9:8). Only Jesus can give you garments that are as white as snow (Rev. 3:5). Are you motivated to serve for His glory or your own?</p>
<p>(f) <span class="underline">A warning. The eternal fire awaits for many</span>. For those who fail to cleanse the sin in their lives, Isaiah warns that they face ruin when they meet their Maker (Is. 6:5). “[B]ut the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 8:12). “[A]nd will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” (Matt. 13:42; 7:19). Are you following Christ’s Great Commission to tell people how to avoid this fate? (Matt. 28:16-20).</p>

<p>le died. The tribe of Benjamin was almost exterminated with only 600 survivors (Jdgs. 20:36-48). Yet, because God is a God of mercy and grace, He gave Benjamin another opportunity to redeem itself. He appointed Saul from this tribe as the first king of Israel. Yet, Saul failed to live by the Spirit. The leadership mantel then fell back to the tribe of Judah through David. Again, the lesson for believers is not to become complacent with God’s blessings.</p>
<p>6. <span class="underline">Jesus’ Promise to Bless You According Your Faith-Driven Works</span>. Gen. 49:28.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Israel blessed each son according to the deeds of each son</span>. Israel did not merely give a blessing according to the mother of each son. Instead, he blessed each son according to the future works of each tribe: “<sup>28 </sup><em>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them. He blessed them, every one with the blessing appropriate to him.”</em> (Gen. 49:28). You cannot earn your salvation through works. If that were the case, Christ’s death would have been meaningless (Gal. 2:21). Yet, like Israel’s sons, God is also faithful to bless you when your faith motivates you to work for Him. For example, although Jacob was a failure most of his life, he was rewarded for his faith in his last moments as he blessed his sons: “By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.” (Heb. 11:21).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jesus will also faithfully bless you when you serve Him in faith</span>. The Bible promises: “For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love which you have shown toward His name, in having ministered and in still ministering to the saints.” (Heb. 6:10). “The LORD will repay each man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD delivered you into my hand today, but I refused to stretch out my hand against the LORD’s anointed.” (1 Sam. 26:23). “The LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands He has recompensed me.” (Ps. 18:20). “And men will say, ‘Surely there is a reward for the righteous; surely there is a God who judges on earth!”’ (Ps. 58:11). Although conduct is not a test for salvation, Jesus makes clear that works done with the right motives can be a test for certain kinds of spiritual blessings. For example, He promised various conditional blessings in the beatitudes. People who stay true to their faith in Christ in the face of persecution will be “blessed” and receive “rewards” in heaven (Matt. 5:11). As another example, He promises “rewards” for those who store up their treasures in heaven (Matt. 6:20). He also promises different types of crowns in heaven, some unrelated to your salvation (e.g., 1 Pet. 5:4). Are you giving Jesus reasons to reward you in heaven?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Give thanks for your unearned right to share in the patriarchs’ blessings</span>. While some blessings are based upon faith-driven works, many more are based upon faith alone. For example, God promised Abraham that, through him, “all the families of the earth will be blessed.” (Gen. 12:3; 17:4; 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14; Josh. 24:3; Is. 51:2). Christ later fulfilled the promise to extend this blessing to believers throughout the world: “And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants, heirs according to promise.” (Gal. 3:29). “It is you who are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed all the families of the Earth shall be blessed.’” (Acts 3:25). “The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, ‘All the nations will be blessed in you.’” (Gal. 3:8). “For this reason it is by faith, in order that it may be in accordance with grace, so that the promise will be guaranteed to all the descendants, not only to those who are of the Law, but also to those who are of the faith of <em>Abraham, who is the father of us all</em>,” (Ro. 4:16). Have you given thanks for your undeserved right to share in these blessings?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Let no one boast about the future</span>. Some of the prophesies have not yet happened. Zebulon, for example, did not dwell in its appointed place at the seashore in Southern Lebanon (Josh. 19:10-16). Likewise, Issachar failed to subdue its enemies (Gen 49:14-15). The tribes of Joseph and Benjamin also lost their blessings because of pride and unrighteousness. Thus, no one should boast about tomorrow (Prov. 27:1). Thus, you should never take your blessings for granted. Out of gratitude, you should always humbly and faithfully serve God.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>7. <span class="underline">Jesus’ Promise of the Blessing of Eternal Life When You Believe in Him</span>. Gen. 49:29-33.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Israel’s final request to be buried in the Promised Land</span>. In his final request before dying, Israel requested to be buried in the Promised Land with Abraham and Isaac: <em>“ <sup>29 </sup>Then he charged them and said to them, ‘I am about to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, <sup>30 </sup>in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought along with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a burial site. <sup>31 </sup>There they buried Abraham and his wife Sarah, there they buried Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and there I buried Leah— <sup>32 </sup>the field and the cave that is in it, purchased from the sons of Heth.’ <sup>33 </sup>When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people</em>.” (Gen. 49:28-33). The only land that Abraham ever owned was a grave at Machpelah (Gen. 23:16-18). Isaac and Ishmael later buried Abraham at this grave (Gen. 25:9). Jacob and Esau later buried Isaac at this same grave (Gen. 35:29). Israel’s sons later faithfully fulfilled his dying request by burying him in this same grave as well (Gen. 50:13).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Give thanks for your unearned right to be resurrected in the eternal Promised Land</span>. The patriarchs looked in faith to their Promised Land. Yet, you have an even better Promised Land. There, you will never experience loss, pain, or discomfort. “And I know how such a man-- whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows-- was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak.” (2 Cor. 12:3-4). “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,” (1 Pet. 1:3-4). All you need to do to share in this amazing inheritance is to believe in Christ as your Lord and Savior. “that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;” (Ro. 10:9; Lk. 10:12:8). Your right to be in the eternal Promised Land is unearned. Have you given thanks for the blessings that Christ has made available to you?</p></li>
