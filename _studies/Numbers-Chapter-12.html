<p>Leviticus Chapter 1 – An Overview of Leviticus and the Seven Meanings of the Burnt Offering</p>
<p>I. <span class="underline">Seven Reasons Why We Should Study the Book of Leviticus</span>.</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">Leviticus is the Heart of God’s Law, and It Reveals the Hidden Sins of the Heart</span>. The Bible proclaims: “All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;” (2 Tim. 3:16). Most believers would agree that the Book of Leviticus is inspired. Many might also agree that it is “profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;” Yet, few churches actually teach through the book. To many, it is inspired in name only. Yet, Leviticus is the central book of the “Torah”, the five holiest books of the Old Testament. It is the “heart” of God’s Law. It was also the heart of Jesus’ Bible when He walked the Earth. Yet, many sadly assume that if Christ came to fulfill the Law, there is no need to study it. But Paul made clear that “through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.” (Rom. 3:20). By studying the heart of God’s Law, we learn of our hidden sins. For “the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked: who can know it?” (Jer. 17:9).</p>
<p>2. <span class="underline">Leviticus Teaches us How to Find Fellowship with God</span>. The first five chapters of Leviticus are the most important because they teach us how to restore our fellowship with God, a primary reason for our existence (1 Jo. 1:3). Chapters 1 through 5 describe: (1) the burnt offering (described in detail below); (2) the grain offering; (3) the peace offering; (4) the ram offering for restitution; and (5) the goat offering for sin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">The Burnt Offering</span>. (Chapter 1). The blood of the animal previously atoned for or paid for a person’s sins. This covered, but did not fully remove, a new believer’s prior sins. Atonement was a necessary step (but not by itself a sufficient step) for a believer to restore true fellowship with God. The reason why atonement does not automatically bring fellowship is that we were “enemies” of God before we were reconciled through Christ’s blood (Ro. 5:10; Phil. 3:18-19). Enemies don’t automatically become friends when they end their hostilities. For Christians, Christ’s death ripped the temple “veil” and gave us direct access to God through Christ (Matt. 27:51; Mk. 15:38). Yet, our “access” to God does not automatically mean that we have “fellowship” with Him (Rev. 3:20). Thus, atonement was merely the first step to finding fellowship with God.</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">The Grain Offering</span>. (Chapter 2). The grain offering symbolized the act of a believer giving the best of his or her life back as a thank you to God for his or her salvation. This symbolizes a believer who is filled with the Holy Spirit and looking for ways to devote his or her life to the Lord out of devotion. This is the next step to finding fellowship.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">The Peace offering</span>. (Chapter 3). The <em>Shalom</em> or peace offering is one of the most important chapters in the Bible. The <em>Shalom</em> offering was so important that the twelve tribes once gave God as part it: 24 bulls, 60 rams, 60 goats and 160 lambs (Nu. 7:88). The <em>Shalom</em> offering symbolizes a believer who was in peaceful fellowship with the Lord. It is not a temporary condition. It instead is a state of being. This offering was the only offering that was voluntary. It was also the only offering where the believer could eat a part of the sacrifice that was given to God. It symbolized a higher walk with God. Christ also offered to believers that they could enjoy spiritual intimacy with Him, symbolized by dining together with Him, like the Shalom offering: “'Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, <em>I will come in to him and will dine with him, and he with Me</em>.” (Rev. 3:20). Christ offered this so that we could find both fellowship and peace through Him (Jo. 16:33). Sadly, many pastors teach that Jesus was speaking to non-believers. Yet, this is mistaken. He was speaking to the “church in Laodicea.” (Rev. 3:14). Some of the members of this church professed Jesus as Lord. Yet, they were not in fellowship with Him. Likewise, many believers have been sadly led to believe that being saved is the end-all be-all of being a Christian. But it is only the first step in a person’s walk with Christ. If we want true peace and fellowship with God, we must accept Jesus’ knock on the door of our heats and carefully study the rules for the Shalom offering in the forgotten heart of God’s Law.</p>
<p>(4) <span class="underline">The Sin Offering</span>. (Chapter 4). The goat offering for sin symbolizes the act of a believer (already saved by the blood of atonement) who still needs blood shed to cleanse the daily sins in the believer’s walk. This was like an alcoholic renouncing an addiction. The washing of the blood could wipe away a believer’s ongoing and daily sins. Yet, a believer still needs to renounce the old ways of the flesh to restore true fellowship. This was symbolized by the goat being cast out of the community with the people’s sins. In summary, the five offerings had the peace offering at the epicenter. The first two offerings were necessary prerequisites to finding peace with God. The last two offerings were necessary to bring a believer back into fellowship with God after a believer sinned.</p>
<p>(5) <span class="underline">The Guilt Offering</span>. (Chapter 5). The guilt offering was designed to maintain fellowship with God by forcing a believer to become aware of and repent of even the smallest sins. It also required that a sinner pay restitution to God and anyone else that the person may have harmed. Although Christians are frequently taught that an apology is enough, God expects a believer to also restore another person after a believer hurts someone else. For example, an apology after a theft may bring God’s forgiveness. But, without restitution to a victim, it is not enough to restore fellowship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. <span class="underline">Leviticus Teaches Us What Kind of “Spiritual Offerings” to Make Out of Our Lives</span>. Christ came to fulfill the sacrificial Law: “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them <em>but to fulfill them</em>.” (Matt. 5:17). His death was a one-time sacrifice for all generations: “For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.” (Heb. 10:14). Yet, this does not mean that Christ left us without anything to do when it comes to the sacrifices listed in Leviticus. We study the details of the animal sacrifices to learn how to make “spiritual sacrifices” to Christ: “you also . . . are . . . to <em>offer up spiritual sacrifices</em> acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.” (1 Pet. 2:5). “Therefore, I urge you, brothers, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as <em>living sacrifices</em>, holy and pleasing to God--this is your spiritual act of worship.” (Rom. 12:1). The bull symbolizes strength. Christ gave His strength for us. We give our strength to Him. The grain offering symbolized the gift of the best of your labors to God. Christ gave the best of His labors to us. We are to give the best of our labors back to Him in gratitude. The lamb symbolized submission. Christ submitted Himself to the will of the Father in death. We are to submit to Christ’s will for our lives. The ram symbolized the payment of restitution for wrongs. Christ paid for our wrongs. We are to respond by making whole anyone that we have wronged. The goat offering symbolized shedding of the sins of our old lives. Christ became the scapegoat of our old lives and made us a new creation. We are to respond by renouncing the flesh and making our bodies “living sacrifices” that are wholly acceptable to God (Rom. 12:1).</p>
<p>4. <span class="underline">Leviticus Teaches Us How to Fulfill the Law of Christ By Caring For Others</span>. Chapters 6 and 7 repeat the sacrificial laws. Yet, they explain the Priest’s role in preparing the sacrifices for others. God taught the Levities His Law so that they could serve those around them who wanted to be reconciled to God. The Levities were commanded to keep the sacrificial fire burning “day and night” in case any person wanted to come forward to be set right with God (Lev. 6:9, 12-13). Helping others to be reconciled to Christ fulfills “the law of Christ.” “Bear one another's burdens, and <em>thereby fulfill the law of Christ</em>.” (Gal. 6:2). “We who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves.” (Rom. 15:1).</p>
<p>5. <span class="underline">Leviticus Instructs Us to Fulfill Our Calling as a “Nation of Priests” for God</span>. Chapters 8 through 10 explain what we must do to be priests for God. Many believe that “priests” are the people who preach on Sundays. Although some Christians use this title for a leader of the congregation, God uses the term more broadly. He makes clear that <em>all</em> of His believers were meant to be His “nation of priests”. This included the Jews: “you shall be my kingdom of priests, my holy nation.” (Ex. 19:6). This also included Christians: “you . . . are being built into a spiritual house to be a <em>holy priesthood</em> . . .” (1 Pet. 2:5). “But you are a chosen people, <em>a royal priesthood</em>, <em>a holy nation</em>, a people belonging to God.” (1 Pet. 2:9). Christ “has <em>made us to be a kingdom and priests</em> to serve his God and Father--to him be glory and power for ever and ever! Amen.” (Rev. 1:6). If you fail to accept that you are part of God’s “nation of priests” you fail to acknowledge one of the reasons why God made you, and you have not fulfilled your calling.</p>
<p>6. <span class="underline">Leviticus Teaches Us How to be Holy in God’s Eyes</span>. As a nation of priests, God gave the instructions in Leviticus so that we could be holy: ‘“For I am the LORD your God. Consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy, for I am holy.”’ (Lev. 11:44). ‘“Be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy.”’ (Lev. 19:2). “You are to be my holy people.” (Ex. 22:31). These instructions also apply to Christians: “for it is written: ‘Be holy, because I am holy.’” (1 Pet. 1:16). If we want to be Holy in God’s eyes, we must study Leviticus. The book teaches us what types of things of the world we may touch or consume with our eyes without defiling ourselves. Chapter 11 explains the dietary laws. Christ cleansed the animals we eat (Acts 10:10-15). Yet, the chapter still has meaning today. The Word of God is considered our spiritual food (Matt. 4:4). The restricted animals each symbolize what we may consume with our eyes. Chapter 12 explains how we circumcise our hearts. Chapters 13 through 15 (the laws regarding leprosy and hygiene) teach us how to deal with our hidden sins and to help a brother or sister deal with the sins in their hearts. Chapter 18 teaches us regarding the laws of sexual purity. Chapters 19 and 20 teach us to be holy through the Ten Commandments and God’s other laws for righteous living. Chapters 21 and 22 teach us that being holy involves being set apart from the sins of the world around us. Part of being holy involves carefully distinguishing the things that Christ fulfilled (the blood sacrifices and dietary laws) and those things which He did not fulfill. For example, Christ raised to an even higher standard for sexual purity by examining our thoughts, not just our actions. The Jews were meant to be a light to the rest of the world (Is. 42:6; 49:6). So are Christians (Matt. 5:14; 1 Pet. 2:4-5). If we are not holy, the light that comes from us does not serve to draw others to God. Instead, it may push them away.</p>
<p>7. <span class="underline">Leviticus Teaches Us How to Honor God</span>. Finally, the book of Leviticus teaches us how to honor God. Chapter 16 instructs us about the holiest day on God’s calendar (a day most Christians sadly ignore) the Day of Atonement. Chapter 17 teaches us to honor the blood that gives us communion with God. Chapter 23 teaches about of the seven festivals of the Messiah and how we should observe them to honor God. Chapter 24 teaches us life lessons in honoring God and serving others through the table of “shewbread” and the golden lamp stand. Chapter 25 teaches us about freedom from bondage and debt through the Jubilee laws. Chapter 26 teaches us about the blessings that come from a life honoring God and the curses for those who live a life that dishonors God. Chapter 27 concludes Leviticus with a discussion regarding the costs of breaking a vow to God. As a “nation of priests” for God, we should only make vows to Him that we will keep. Yet, if you can make a vow to God that you will keep, like your wedding vow, it is one of the highest ways to honor Him.</p>
<p>II. <span class="underline">The Seven Meanings of the Burnt Offerings in Leviticus Chapter 1</span>.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span>: There are seven messages for every believer in the first chapter of Leviticus. <span class="underline">First</span>, every person must accept that sin creates a barrier between them and God. <span class="underline">Second</span>, only through a proper blood sacrifice can a person atone for their sins. <span class="underline">Third</span>, the sacrifice had to be without blemish or sin. <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, the blood sacrifice only worked if the person had faith in God’s ability to transfer their sins to the sacrifice. <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, the Old Testament left the Jews with the need for a better way to atone for sins. Their system could only “cover” sin, not remove it. Their system also broke down when the Romans destroyed the Second Temple shortly after Jesus’ death. Today, there is no way for the Jews to strictly follow the sacrificial laws to atone for their sins. Christ provided the answer. His blood was without blemish. Our sins can be transferred to Him if we have faith in Him. He further came as a one-time sacrifice to fulfill the sacrificial Law. <span class="underline">Sixth</span>, this chapter also reveals that a person must still wash of their daily sins after they received atonement through the blood sacrifice. Believers today cannot just accept Christ and never look back at Him again. Believers must wash in His Word to cleanse themselves on a daily basis. <span class="underline">Finally</span>, although believers no longer need to make physical sacrifices, they are called upon to make “spiritual sacrifices” out of gratitude for what Christ did for them (1 Pet. 2:5). This includes making their lives a “living sacrifice” for Him (Ro. 12:1).</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">Recognize the Barrier Sin Creates Between You and God</span>. Ex. 40:34-35; Lev. 1:1-2</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Sin separated Moses from God</span>. Leviticus begins where Exodus leaves off. God’s presence has entered the just completed tabernacle, where God could dwell with his people (Ex. 40:34-35). Sin, however, separated Moses from God. For this reason, Moses could not be in God’s direct presence in the tent of meeting. If Moses had tried to enter with his sins, he would have died. God cannot be in the presence of sin. To solve this problem, God called to Moses to obtain animals to make an offerings to God. “<em>Then the Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying, ‘Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When any man of you brings an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of animals from the herd or the flock</em>.”’’ (Lev. 1:1-2). If Moses could not stand before God, we must suffer from the same problem.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Sin has also separated us from God</span>. Like Moses, sin has also separated us from God: “But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God . . .” (Isaiah 59:2(a)). God has looked down from heaven and observed that not one person is holy and without sin: “[I]t is written, ‘There is none righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.”’ (Rom. 3:10-11). “[T]here is no one who does good.” (Ps. 14:1; 53:1). “Do not bring your servant into judgment, for no one living is righteous before you.” (Ps. 143:2). “If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us.” (1 Jo. 1:8). Thus, if we say that we are going to heaven because we are good people, the truth is not within us. Likewise, if we are going to heaven because of our good works, Christ’s death on the cross was unnecessary.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Sin can also “hinder” your prayers to God</span>. In the Old Testament, God warned that as a consequence of the separation caused by sin, He would not hear the prayers of sinners: “So when you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide My eyes from you; yes, even though you multiply prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood.” (Is. 1:15). “And your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear. For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken falsehood, your tongue mutters wickedness.” (Is. 59:2-3(b)). “We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but He does listen to anyone who worships Him and does His will.” (Jo. 9:31; Prov. 15:29; 8:9; Ps. 66:18). In the New Testament, He warns that sin can “hinder” a believer’s prayers (1 Pet. 3:7).</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The penalty for our sins is death</span>. The animal sacrifices were performed in the courtyard of the Tabernacle at an altar called the <em>mizbeach</em> (Ex. 27:1-8). This altar was made of acacia wood with bronze overlaid on top of the wood (Ex. 38:2). Bronze represents judgment in the Bible (e.g., Jesus’ “bronze” feet (Rev. 1:15) will crush Satan (Rom. 16:20)). The fire inside the altar where the fire burned also symbolized God’s judgment: “for our God is a consuming fire.” (Heb. 12:29; 10:27; Ex. 24:17; Dt. 4:24; 9:3; Ps. 97:3; Is. 33:14; 2 Thess. 1:7). The animal was also cut into pieces (Gen. 15:10, 17). This showed that nothing is hidden before the Lord at the time of judgment (Ecc. 12:14). It also symbolized a solemn covenant. We also cannot treat sin lightly (Rom. 6:26). “For the wages of sin is death, . .” (Rom. 6:23). Unless we accept that we are destined for judgment, we will feel no pressure to repent. Thus, are we helping others when we stay silent about God’s judgment of sin?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <span class="underline">The Reason For the Blood Sacrifice to Atone for Sins</span>. Lev. 1:3-17.</p>
<p><span class="underline">God’s Law for the atonement on sin</span>. Once we recognize that sin has created a barrier between us and God, we must ask how we can remove this barrier to fellowship with God. God ultimately choose blood as the symbol of atonement. “<sup>3 </sup><em>If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer it, a male without defect; he shall offer it at the doorway of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>4 </sup>He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, that it may be accepted for him to make atonement on his behalf. <sup>5 </sup>He shall slay the young bull before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; and Aaron’s sons the priests shall offer up the blood and sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is at the doorway of the tent of meeting. <sup>6 </sup>He shall then skin the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces. <sup>7 </sup>The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. <sup>8 </sup>Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, the head and the suet over the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar. <sup>9 </sup>Its entrails, however, and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer up in smoke all of it on the altar for a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>10 </sup>‘But if his offering is from the flock, of the sheep or of the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer it a male without defect. <sup>11 </sup>He shall slay it on the side of the altar northward before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. <sup>12 </sup>He shall then cut it into its pieces with its head and its suet, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar. <sup>13 </sup>The entrails, however, and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer all of it, and offer it up in smoke on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>14 </sup>‘But if his offering to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering from the turtledoves or from young pigeons. <sup>15 </sup>The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head and offer it up in smoke on the altar; and its blood is to be drained out on the side of the altar. <sup>16 </sup>He shall also take away its crop with its feathers and cast it beside the altar eastward, to the place of the ashes. <sup>17 </sup>Then he shall tear it by its wings, but shall not sever it. And the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar on the wood which is on the fire; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span></em>.” (Lev. 1:3-17). Each detail of the blood offering pointed to Christ.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Why God chose the symbol of blood for atonement</span>. Why would God choose blood as His symbol of atonement? God chose blood for several reasons. First, it is gross to look at. it lets us know how gross our sins are before God. Second, blood is the agent of life for all the organs in the body. It brings life giving oxygen. Third, blood is also a cleansing agent. It carries impurities from the body to the kidneys where the impurities are filtered and removed from the body. “[T]he life of every creature is its blood.” (Lev. 17:14). “[Y]ou must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it.” (Gen. 9:4). Fourth, the shedding of the blood symbolized the exchange one life for another life: ‘“For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for <em>it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement</em>.”’ (Lev. 17:11). The rule requiring that the blood or life of one be used to pay the price of another still applies in the New Testament: “In fact, the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood, and <em>without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness</em>.” (Heb. 9:22). Besides the shedding of blood, God does not leave any way other in either the Old Testament or the New Testament to remove the barrier of sin between man and God. If you say that you are sorry to God for your sins but fail to offer a blood sacrifice to atone for your sins (as Jews do today), this does not comply with God’s law. Some might be tempted to protest that there must be a better way to pay for our sins. But what do you have to offer God to pay for your sins? God will non&gt;. As part of the rules for “ritual purity” as opposed to moral purity, the Jews were also prohibited from having relations during the time of menstruation: “<sup>18 </sup><em>If there is a man who lies with a menstruous woman and uncovers her nakedness, he has laid bare her flow, and she has exposed the flow of her blood; thus both of them shall be cut off from among their people</em>.” (Lev. 20:18). “Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity.” (Lev. 18:19). Earlier in the book of Leviticus, God specified that the duration of the couple’s punishment was a seven-day bar from entering the Temple for worship: “If a man actually lies with her so that her menstrual impurity is on him, <em>he shall be unclean seven days</em>, and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.” (Lev. 15:24). Childbirth and menstruation were cursed because of original sin (Gen. 3:16). The life of a person is in the blood (Lev. 17:11). The loss of this blood was a symbol of this sin. Even this symbol of sin could not be in God’s presence during Temple events. Because the Temple no longer exists, this rule no longer applies. Yet, even though it is not required, many believers still voluntarily observe this rule out of respect for God. He tells believers to always be holy (1 Pet. 1:16).</p>
<p>(10) <span class="underline">God’s punishment for sleeping with an aunt or uncle</span>. God also promises to punish any person who sleeps with an aunt or uncle: “<sup>19 </sup><em>You shall also not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister or of your father’s sister, for such a one has made naked his blood relative; they will bear their guilt</em>.” (Lev. 20:19). “You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is your father’s blood relative. You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s blood relative. <sup>14 </sup>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother; you shall not approach his wife, she is your aunt.” (Lev. 18:12-14). Like the other Old Testament rules for sexual purity, there is nothing in the New Testament to suggest that Christ repealed these rules.</p>
<p>(11) <span class="underline">God’s punishment for sleeping with the spouse of an aunt or uncle</span>. In addition to prohibiting relations with an aunt or uncle, God also promises to punish a person who sleeps with the spouse of an aunt or uncle: “<sup>20 </sup><em>If there is a man who lies with his uncle’s wife he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness; they will bear their sin. They will die childless</em>.” (Lev. 20:20). No matter who the relative is, believers must always respect God’s standards of morality.</p>
<p>(12) <span class="underline">God’s punishment for sleeping with a sister or brother-in-law</span>. Finally, God promises to punish any person who sleeps with the spouse of a sibling: “<sup>21 </sup><em>If there is a man who takes his brother’s wife, it is abhorrent; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They will be childless</em>.” (Lev. 20:21). “<sup>16 </sup><em>You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife; it is your brother’s nakedness</em>.” (Lev. 18:16). There was one exception to this rule. In the days before social security and government support systems for widows, God permitted a marriage between a kinsman redeemer (a brother-in-law or a cousin) and the surviving widow to support the widow and her family (Dt. 25:5-10). This was known as either a “levirate marriage” (Latin) or a“<em>yibbum” (Hebrew).</em> The story of Tamar is an example of a failed <em>yibbum. Today, no exception to this rule exists in either Jewish or Christian culture because the state provides other means to provide for a widow and her family. Again, believers must respect and obey God’s standards of purity and morality.</em></p>
<p>6. <span class="underline">God Will Punish Societies that Permit Prohibited Sexual Relations</span>. Lev. 20:22-24.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s punishment for societies which permit prohibited sexual relations</span>. Many believers find a libertarian view of the world to be intellectually appealing. As long as the believer follows God’s Law regarding sexual purity and morality, why should the believer care what the rest of the world does? The problem with this libertarian world view is that God promises to punish entire societies (including the believers within it) when society as a whole rejects His law regarding sexual morality. In the case of the Jews, He promised to throw them into exile if they adopted the sexual morals of the people of Canaan: “<sup>22 </sup>‘<em>You are therefore to keep all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them, <span class="underline">so that the land to which I am bringing you to live will not spew you out</span>. <sup>23 </sup>Moreover, you shall not follow the customs of the nation which I will drive out before you, for they did all these things, and therefore I have abhorred them. <sup>24 </sup>Hence I have said to you, “You are to possess their land, and I Myself will give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey.” I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, who has separated you from the peoples.”</em> (Lev. 20:22-24). Unlike other sins, God also punished entire populations for same sex acts. There are two examples of this in the Old Testament. First, through Noah, He cursed Ham for getting his father Noah drunk and then performing a same sex act upon his father. This curse extended to Ham’s descendants in Canaan (Gen. 9:24-25). Second, God found the sexual sins of Sodom to be exceedingly great (Gen. 18:20). Then, after the people of Sodom tried to forcibly sodomize the angels that God sent into the city to rescue Lot, He swiftly destroyed both cities: “Then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven,” (Gen. 19:24). He repeated the punishments against these two cities in the New Testament as a warning to societies regarding the punishment that awaits them when they reject His Law of sexual purity: “[J]ust as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way <em>as these indulged in gross immorality and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example in undergoing the punishment of eternal fire</em>.” (Jude 1:7). “[I]f He condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction by reducing them to ashes, having made them an example to those who would live ungodly lives thereafter;” (2 Pet. 2:6). Jesus also cited to the example of Sodom and Gomorrah to warn of the sins that were severe enough to bring judgment upon entire cities and countries, not just individuals: “Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.” (Matt. 10:15). “Nevertheless I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for you.” (Matt. 11:24). “I say to you, it will be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.” (Lk. 10:12). These warnings provide a challenge to churches which strive to be “seeker friendly”. Yet, if a church loses its saltiness as an irritant in the wound of sin, Jesus warns that “It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled under foot by men.” (Matt. 5:13).</p></li>

<p>7. <span class="underline">God Wants You to Avoid Any Unclean Thing of the World</span>. Lev. 20:25-26.</p>

Finally, God commanded that the people avoid the unclean things of the world and be holy in all that they do: “<sup>25 </sup><em>You are therefore to make a distinction between the clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; and you shall not make yourselves detestable by animal or by bird or by anything that creeps on the ground, which I have separated for you as unclean. <sup>26 </sup>Thus you are to be holy to Me, for I the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> am holy; and I have set you apart from the peoples to be Mine</em>.” (Lev. 20:25-26). We cannot look to public opinion to discern what is good and holy. God warns that His ways and His thoughts are not ours: ‘“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,’ declares the LORD.” (Is. 55:8). Furthermore, although public opinion may change, Jesus and His teachings do not change or evolve: “Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.” (Heb. 13:8). Even in the New Testament, God declared the Law of the Old Testament to be “holy”: “So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.” (Ro. 7:12). Believers are commanded to always be holy. (1 Pet. 1:16). To be holy, believers must avoid the things that glorify the flesh: “But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;” (Eph. 5:3). “Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality,” (Gal. 5:19). “Flee immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, but the immoral man sins against his own body.” (1 Cor. 6:18). Jesus also warned that all kinds of “sexual impurities” (which included same sex acts and other prohibited acts) defile a man (Matt. 15:19-20; Mk. 7:20-23). Are you keeping yourself pure from the unclean things of the world?</p></li>
