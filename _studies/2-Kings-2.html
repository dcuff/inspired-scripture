<p>2 Kings 24: Seven Lessons from Judah’s Three Final Wicked Kings For Surviving Your Trials</p>
<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span>: This chapter tells of Judah’s demise under its last three kings. These included (1) Jehoiakim (Eliakim), (2) Jehoiachin (Coniah) and (3) Zedekiah (Mattaniah). Like most of their predecessors, these kings embraced evil. God then removed His hand of protection and allowed Nebuchadnezzar II to gain control of Judah and deport its people. The people suffered because of the sins of these three kings and the evil kings who preceded them. Even God’s prophets were deported because of the sins of these leaders. Jesus does not promise every believer a stress-free life. Like the Jews, you will frequently experience tribulation: “These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33). From the mistakes of Judah’s final leaders, God reveals seven lessons for surviving your trials. These include: (1) faith / trust, (2) repentance, (3) fear God, (4) hope, (5) dependence, (6) humility, and (7) obedience.</p>
<p><span class="underline">First</span>, King Jehoiakim / Eliakim faced an invasion from a far superior army under Nebuchadnezzar II from Babylonian. Initially, Jehoiakim submitted to Nebuchadnezzar II. Yet, he then put his trust in an alliance with Egypt to rebel against Babylon. This would lead to Judah’s destruction. God wants you to learn from this mistake to put your faith and trust in Him, not the world. <span class="underline">Second</span>, Jehoiakim failed to repent of his sins. He instead adopted the sinful ways of his predecessors. Thus, God fulfilled a promise of judgment that He gave to Manasseh. From Jehoiakim’s mistakes, God wants you to learn to repent of your sins and change your ways. <span class="underline">Third</span>, Jehoiachin took power after Jehoiakim. Despite observing God judge Jehoiakim and hearing of God’s warnings of judgement against Judah, Jehoiachin continued his father’s sins. He did this because he did not fear God. The Bible defines the fear God as hating the evil. God wants you to learn from Jehoiachin’s mistakes by hating what He defines as evil. <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, God allowed the Jews to be taken into captivity in three waves. Even God’s prophets were taken captive. God allowed the Jews to experience captivity so that the Jews would place their hope in Him. In your hour of darkness, God wants you to also learn to put your hope in Him. <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, God allowed Nebuchadnezzar II to strip Judah of all of its wealth and talent. He left only poor people behind. God allowed this so that the Jews would learn to depend upon Him and not in their wealth for deliverance. God also wants you to depend upon Him and not in your wealth. <span class="underline">Sixth</span>, God allowed Nebuchadnezzar II to take the proud people of Judah and humble them as slaves. He wants you to learn to humble yourself before Him. If you are prideful, He may be forced to humble you to save you from yourself. <span class="underline">Finally</span>, Zedekiah brought further tragedy upon Judah because he refused to obey God’s prophet Jeremiah. Instead, he obeyed false prophets who encouraged him to form a new alliance with Egypt and again rebel against Babylon. From Zedekiah’s mistakes, God wants you to obey His Word and not your own understanding.</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">Faith / Trust: Put Your Faith and Trust in God, Not the World</span>. 2 Kgs. 24:1.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">God allows Nebuchadnezzar II to control Judah</span>. As part of God’s judgment against Judah, He allowed the Babylonians to gain control over it. Yet, three years after the Babylonians gained control, King Jehoiakim / Eliakim led Judah in a failed rebellion against them: “<sup>1</sup> <em>In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant for three years; then he turned and rebelled against him</em>.” (2 Kgs. 24:1). At a time when Judah was weak, Pharaoh Neco previously appointed Josiah’s evil son Eliakim as King of Judah, and he renamed him Jehoiakim to demonstrate his control over him (2 Kgs. 23:24). Jehoiakim / Eliakim heavily taxed the Jews to pay tribute to his master in Egypt (2 Kgs. 23:25). This weakened Judah’s ability to defend itself. In 605 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar II, the then crown prince of Babylon, gained control over Judah after he defeated the Assyrians and the Egyptians at Carchemish in northern Syria. He then chased the Egyptians back to the Sinai Peninsula. He seized Judah and made it a vassal state because the Jews had become loyal to Babylon’s enemy in Egypt. Also in 605 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar II raced back to Babylon to succeed his father Nabopolassar to become King of Babylon. He reigned from 605 B.C. to 562 B.C. With him, he took the first wave of deportees to Babylon in 605 B.C. These included the prophet Daniel and his friends (Dan. 1:1-3). Between 605 and 587 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar II invaded and deported the Jews two more times. Jehoiakim / Eliakim submitted to Nebuchadnezzar II first as crown prince and at first when he became king three years into Jehoiakim’s reign (Jer. 25:1). Yet, after three years of Babylonian rule, Jehoiakim / Eliakim joined with the Egyptians to rebel against Nebuchadnezzar II. The two powers assumed that Babylon was weak and distracted with the death of Nebuchadnezzar’s father. Jehoiakim / Eliakim formed this alliance and attacked against the warnings of the prophet Jeremiah (Jer. 27:9-11). In 597 in 587 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar II invaded and deported the Jews two more times. Jehoiakim / Eliakim failed to trust in God. Instead, he placed his trust in Egypt.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jehoiakim / Eliakim pursued evil instead of righteousness</span>. The Bible records that Jehoiakim / Eliakim: “did evil in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to all that his fathers had done.” (2 Kgs. 23:37). This means that he pursued idolatry. He also placed his trust in the world and his own strength instead of trusting in God and living righteously.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Place your trust in God and not in powerful people or yourself</span>. God warned His people to trust in Him and not in human leaders for their deliverance. “Do not trust in princes, in mortal man, in whom there is no salvation.” (Ps. 146:3). “It is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in princes.” (Ps. 118:9). “O give us help against the adversary, for deliverance by man is in vain.” (Ps. 60:11). Jehoiakim / Eliakim placed his trust in a pharaoh. Many today may see no connection in this to the modern world. Yet, it is common during elections in western nations for people to put their hopes in one political party or in one candidate. It is important to care about who is elected. A Spirit-led leader can lead a nation into God’s blessings, and a rebellious leader can lead a nation into God’s curses. Yet, like everyone else, leaders will sin (Ro. 3:23). Thus, you should never place your hopes in leaders. Instead, place your hope in Jesus (1 Tim. 6:17).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <span class="underline">Repentance: Repent of Your Sins and Change Your Ways</span>. 2 Kgs. 24:2-5.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">God sends foreign oppressors against Judah because of its sins</span>. Because Jehoiakim / Eliakim refused to trust God, God sent foreign invaders to cause the Jews to turn back to Him. Yet, because the Jews would not repent of their evil ways, God fulfilled His prior judgments upon King Manasseh: “<sup>2 </sup><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> sent against him bands of Chaldeans, bands of Arameans, bands of Moabites, and bands of Ammonites. So He sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> which He had spoken through His servants the prophets. <sup>3 </sup>Surely at the command of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> it came upon Judah, to remove them from His sight because of the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he had done, <sup>4 </sup>and also for the innocent blood which he shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; and the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> would not forgive. <sup>5 </sup>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</em>” (2 Kgs. 24:2-5). The prophets Jeremiah, Isaiah, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, and Micah had all preached warnings of God’s judgment and the need for the Jews to repent. God had also judged the Jews for their sins that they willingly committed under both King Manasseh and King Amon. This included the adoption of all the detestable practices of the condemned Canaanites and the now extinct nation of Northern Israel (2 Kgs. 16:3; 21:2; Dt. 18:9-12). Following these practices expressly violated God’s law (Dt. 12:29-31). Yet, the Jews would not repent. Before Nebuchadnezzar II invaded again, God allowed other lesser nations to attack Judah from different directions and weaken it. The Jews, however, again would not repent. Jehoiakim / Eliakim even murdered the prophet Urijah. Thus, God fulfilled His prior judgment against Manasseh.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Manasseh’s seven deadly sins</span>. Manasseh holds the dubious distinction as the most evil King of Judah (2 Chron. 33:1-9). He rejected the reforms that his father Hezekiah had instituted. Instead, in the beginning, he emulated his evil grandfather Ahaz of Judah. Then then emulated and exceeded the evil of King Ahab in Northern Israel. Manasseh’s seven deadly sins included but are not limited to the following. <span class="underline">First</span>, he reinstituted Ahab’s practices of Baal and Asherah worship (2 Kgs. 21:3). This violated God’s First Commandment against worshipping other gods (Ex. 20:3; Dt. 5:7). Because Asherah worship involved ritual sex, he turned the Temple into a brothel. <span class="underline">Second</span>, he rebuilt the pagan altars that Hezekiah faithfully destroyed (2 Kgs. 21:3). God ordered the Jews to destroy these altars (Dt. 12:2-3; Jer. 2:20). This also violated God’s Second Commandment against idolatry (Ex. 20:4-6; Dt. 5:8-10). <span class="underline">Third</span>, he went beyond Ahab’s idolatry by following Babylonian worship of the sun, moon, and stars through astrology (2 Kgs. 21:3). In addition to again violating the First Commandment, God separately prohibited astrology because of the demonic influences that it involved: “And beware not to lift up your eyes to heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and be drawn away and worship them and serve them, those which the LORD your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole heaven.” (Dt. 4:19; 17:2-5). <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, he desecrated God’s Temple with pagan altars (2 Kgs. 21:4, 7). God “put [His] name forever in the Temple (1 Kgs. 8:29; 9:3; 21:7). Thus, his actions also blasphemed God’s holy name. This in turn violated the Third Commandment (Ex. 20:7; Dt. 5:11). <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, he practiced witchcraft and divination, and he dealt with mediums and spiritists (2 Kgs. 21:6). This was also expressly prohibited under God’s law (Lev. 19:31; Dt. 18:9-12). This placed him in direct communion with demonic forces. Indeed, God condemned Saul to death for speaking with a medium (1 Sam. 28:16-19). <span class="underline">Sixth,</span> he sacrificed his own son through fire to the pagan god Molech (2 Kgs. 21:6). This also directly violated God’s law: “You shall not give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am the LORD.” (Lev. 18:21; Dt. 18:10-12). Ahaz was the only other king in Judah to do this (2 Kgs. 16:3) This practice was so offensive to God that it was a reason for His judgement of the Ammonites (Gen. 15:16; Dt. 20:17). <span class="underline">Finally</span>, he murdered God’s prophets, including Isaiah (2 Kgs. 21:16). This violated the Sixth Commandment against murder (Ex. 20:13; Dt. 5:17). Sadly, the Jews continued to persecute those who spoke God’s Word (Jer. 26:21). Jehoiakim / Eliakim’s murder of the prophet Urijah showed how little he had learned. It was only out of mercy and grace and God’s covenant with David that he did not die (2 Sam. 7:11-13).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God tested the Jews with foreign invasions so that they would return to Him</span>. Moses warned the Jews that God tested them to expose their sins: “for God has come in order to <em>test you</em>, and in order that the fear of Him may remain with you, <em>so that you may not sin</em>.” (Ex. 20:20(b); Dt. 8:2). David also warned that even the righteous are not beyond God’s testing: “<em>The Lord tests the righteous and the wicked</em> . . .” (Ps. 11:5). “I, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, search the heart, <em>I test the mind</em>, . . .” (Jer. 17:10). God’s testing and discipline are done out of love (Heb. 12:6). When you are tested, you may find that your heart has hidden anger, lust, or covetousness. When God exposes wickedness, He expects you to repent of it: “the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked: who can know it?” (Jer. 17:9). David invited God’s testing to show him where he needed to change (Ps. 139:23). When God tests you and exposes your sins, do you repent?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God desires a contrite and repentant heart</span>. God wanted the Jews to recognize and repent of their sins. “The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, o God, You will not despise.” (Ps. 51:17). Jesus also began His ministry by preaching repentance: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matt. 3:2). One commentator observes: “Many in the days of Jehoiakim believed that God’s will was to deliver them from their enemies and to preserve an independent Judah. Yet that was not God’s will; it was His will to bring Judah into judgment (knowing they had not genuinely repented and would not). The best thing for Judah to do was to <em>submit</em> to this will of God, as Jeremiah told them to do – despite great opposition.” (David Guzik on 2 Kgs. 24). When God exposes your sins, repent of them so that He can forgive you. “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 Jo. 1:9).</p></li>

<p>3. <span class="underline">Fear God: Fear God by Hating the Evil Things of the World</span>. 2 Kgs. 24:6-9.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jehoiachin reigns and does evil in God’s eyes</span>. Following the death of Jehoiakim / Eliakim, his son Jehoiachin became King of Judah. Even after God took his hope of Egyptian protection away, Jehoiachin did evil in God’s eyes: “<sup>6 </sup><em>So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin his son became king in his place. <sup>7 </sup>The king of Egypt did not come out of his land again, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the brook of Egypt to the river Euphrates. <sup>8 </sup>Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Nehushta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. <sup>9 </sup>He did evil in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, according to all that his father had done</em>.” (2 Kgs. 24:6-9). Jehoiachin is known by Jechonias, Jechoniah, Jeconiah, and Coniah. He became king at age 18. Yet, because he pursued evil, God allowed him to reign for only three months.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jehoiachin observed God’s judgment upon Eliakim</span>. At age 18, Jehoiachin observed God judge his father. According to the prophecy of Jeremiah, Eliakim’s died without a burial or any honor (Jer. 22:18). The Babylonians captured him and bound him in chains to bring him to Babylon. Yet, after leaving Jerusalem, he died and received no burial (2 Chron. 36:6). At this time, the Babylonians also captured some of the treasures in God’s Temple and carried them to Babylon (2 Chron. 36:7). If Jehoiachin were a God-fearing king, he would have repented. But he didn’t.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jehoiachin observed God’s judgment upon Judah’s only ally, Egypt</span>. In 601 B.C., at the end of the reign of Jehoiakim / Eliakim, Nebuchadnezzar II defeated the Egyptians and drove them to back to their territory. The Egyptians’ army never again left its territory (2 Kgs. 24:7). This deprived Judah of its only ally and only means of defending itself against Babylon. A God-fearing king would repented and turned to God for help against the Babylonians. Yet, neither Jehoiakim / Eliakim nor Jehoiachin turned to God.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jehoiachin observed Jehoiakim / Eliakim’s evil acts and copied them</span>. Despite seeing God’s judgment and hearing from God’s prophets, Jehoiachin continued in his father’s evil acts before God. This most likely included idolatry (2 Kgs. 24:9; Jer. 22:24). Thus, God lifted His hand of protection, and Jehoiachin’s reign ended after only three months.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jehoiachin heard God’s warnings of judgment and ignored them</span>. Through His prophets, God warned Judah before sending its people into exile: “Yet the LORD warned Israel and Judah through all His prophets and every seer, saying, ‘Turn from your evil ways and keep My commandments, My statutes according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you through My servants the prophets.”’ (2 Kgs. 17:13). Dating back to Solomon, God warned that open disobedience would bring His judgment upon His peoples: ‘“<sup>6</sup> But if you or your sons indeed turn away from following Me, and do not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and worship them, <sup>7 </sup>then I will cut off Israel from the land which I have given them, and the house which I have consecrated for My name, I will cast out of My sight. So Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples. <sup>8 </sup>And this house will become a heap of ruins; everyone who passes by will be astonished and hiss and say, ‘Why has the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> done thus to this land and to this house?’ <sup>9 </sup>And they will say, ‘Because they forsook the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> their God, who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and adopted other gods and worshiped them and served them, therefore the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has brought all this adversity on them.’” (1 Kgs. 9:6-9). The people, however, would not listen to God’s prophets because they were stiff necked and unwilling to listen: “But they, our fathers, acted arrogantly; they became stubborn and would not listen to Your commandments. . . . And admonished them in order to turn them back to Your law. Yet they acted arrogantly and did not listen to Your commandments but sinned against Your ordinances, by which if a man observes them he shall live. And they turned a stubborn shoulder and stiffened their neck, and would not listen.” (Neh. 9:16, 29). “So now then, speak to the men of Judah and against the inhabitants of Jerusalem saying, ‘Thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I am fashioning calamity against you and devising a plan against you. Oh turn back, each of you from his evil way, and reform your ways and your deeds.’’ But they will say, ‘It's hopeless! For we are going to follow our own plans, and each of us will act according to the stubbornness of his evil heart.’” (Jer. 18:11). “So I will choose their punishments and will bring on them what they dread. Because I called, but no one answered; I spoke, but they did not listen. And they did evil in My sight and chose that in which I did not delight.” (Is. 66:4). Because God is just, He gives many warnings to sinners before He is forced to judge unrepentant sin.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Fear God by hating evil</span>. Jehoiachin did not respond to God’s many warnings because he did not fear God. “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; Fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7). Many assume that a just and loving God will never judge sin. Yet, because God is just, He must judge sin. Even when Jesus takes your judgment, there are still consequences for sin. To keep yourself from sinning, you must fear God. This is defined in the Bible as hating evil: “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; . . .” (Prov. 8:13). “Hate evil, you who love the LORD, who preserves the souls of His godly ones; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.” (Ps. 97:10). “Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.” (Ro. 12:9(b)). If you are tolerating what God calls evil in your life, you may also return to your sins.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <span class="underline">Hope: In Your Hour of Darkness, Put Your Hope in Jesus</span>. 2 Kgs. 24:10-12.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Nebuchadnezzar II defeats and deports the Jews</span>. Nebuchadnezzar II fulfilled God’s judgment against the Jews by capturing Jerusalem and taking its leaders prisoner: “<sup>10 </sup><em>At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon went up to Jerusalem, and the city came under siege. <sup>11 </sup>And Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon came to the city, while his servants were besieging it. <sup>12 </sup>Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he and his mother and his servants and his captains and his officials. So the king of Babylon took him captive in the eighth year of his reign</em>.” (2 Kgs. 24:10-12). In 597 B.C., eight years into Nebuchadnezzar II’s reign, he captured Jerusalem. That same year, he also took a second wave of Jewish captives into exile. The prophet Ezekiel was part of the second wave of captives that Nebuchadnezzar II sent into exile (Ezek. 1:1).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jehoiachin observed Nebuchadnezzar II’s invasion but failed to repent</span>. If Jehoiachin were a godly king, he would have turned to God upon hearing of the Babylonian army’s advance. Yet, because his heart was evil, he failed to turn to God. Thus, God lifted His hand of protection, and the Babylonians took Jehoiachin into captivity for 36 years.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s Word (including His law) will keep you from returning to the bondage of sin</span>. God deported the Jews because they rejected His law. “<sup>64 </sup>Moreover, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will scatter you among all peoples, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth; and there you shall serve other gods, wood and stone, which you or your fathers have not known. <sup>65 </sup>Among those nations you shall find no rest, and there will be no resting place for the sole of your foot; but there the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> will give you a trembling heart, failing of eyes, and despair of soul.” (Dt. 28:64-65). By placing Judah under Nebuchadnezzar II’s physical captivity, God made manifest the spiritual captivity that already existed in the Jews’ hearts. God desired to set His people free from bondage: “With a powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of slavery.”’ (Ex. 13:14(b)). Jesus also came to free mankind from the bondage to sin and human oppression that humans have imposed upon themselves. On the first day ofpride and rage because Elisha did not do what he wanted (2 Kgs. 5:11-12). Now, he bowed in humility, and he asked Elisha that God pardon him. He further called himself Elisha’s servant (2 Kgs. 5:18). He previously disparaged the River Jordan (2 Kgs. 5:12). Now, he wanted to take soil back from the Promised Land to Damascus to build an altar to worship Yahweh there (2 Kgs. 5:17). Elisha rejected any type of gift because he did not want to profit off of God’s miracles. He also did not want to tarnish God’s holy image to the gentiles in Syria.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Give thanks to Jesus for your undeserved transformation</span>. This account foreshadowed Jesus’ healing of the 10 lepers. Only one of the 10 lepers (also a foreigner) came back to thank Jesus. The Jewish lepers took Jesus’ healing for granted. Yet the foreigner came back to thank Jesus because he saw that he did not deserve to be healed. “<sup>15 </sup>Now one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice, <sup>16 </sup>and he fell on his face at His feet, giving thanks to Him. And he was a Samaritan. <sup>17 </sup>Then Jesus answered and said, ‘Were there not ten cleansed? But the nine—where are they?”’ (Lk. 17:15-17). The Samaritan saw himself as a sinner who needed Jesus’ mercy and grace. Like the Samaritan, do you remember to stop and thank Jesus for all His acts of mercy and grace in your life?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Confess Jesus as your Lord and Savior</span>. Naaman’s conversion included a public declaration of faith in Yahweh. By his faith, God healed him: “And He said to her, ‘Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace and be healed of your affliction.”’ (Mk. 5:34). His public confession was similar to those of Rahab “When we heard it, our hearts melted and no courage remained in any man any longer because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath.” (Josh. 2:11) and Ruth: “But Ruth said, ‘ . . . Your people shall be my people, and your God, my God.”’ (Ruth 1:16). Moses also made a similar declaration: “Know therefore today, and take it to your heart, that the LORD, He is God in heaven above and on the earth below; there is no other.” (Dt. 4:39). The Jews had also seen God perform many miracles. Yet, his faith exceeded the Jews’ faith because most had succumbed to Baal worship.</p></li>

<p>6. <span class="underline">Righteousness: God Expects You to Walk in Righteousness &amp; Integrity</span>. 2 Kgs. 5:20-24.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Gehazi’s greed and lies</span>. After Elisha turned down Naaman’s offers of gifts for both himself and his servant Gehazi, Gehazi became filled with greed. Thus, Gehazi pursued after Naaman after he made up a lie to receive his gift: “<sup>20 </sup><em>But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, ‘Behold, my master has spared this Naaman the Aramean, by not receiving from his hands what he brought. As the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> lives, I will run after him and take something from him.’ <sup>21 </sup>So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw one running after him, he came down from the chariot to meet him and said, ‘Is all well?’ <sup>22 </sup>He said, ‘All is well. My master has sent me, saying, ‘Behold, just now two young men of the sons of the prophets have come to me from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothes.’’ <sup>23 </sup>Naaman said, ‘Be pleased to take two talents.’ And he urged him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes and gave them to two of his servants; and they carried them before him. <sup>24 </sup>When he came to the hill, he took them from their hand and deposited them in the house, and he sent the men away, and they departed.</em>” (2 Kgs. 5:20-24). Gehazi and Naaman provided stark contrasts in their walks with God. Gehazi outwardly looked like a righteous man. He served Elisha and lived in poverty. Yet, inwardly, he was filled with covetousness. Naaman’s offer of riches proved too tempting for him to turn down. He justified his greed by speaking with contempt that a foreigner received a healing without paying any money. Thus, he ran to fill his greedy heart. Even worse, he lied about God and made up a story about alleged prophets in need. He requested two talents of silver, together weighing approximately 150 pounds. In contrast, Naaman had a transformed heart. He got off of his chariot to meet Elisha’s servant as an equal. He assumed that Gehazi spoke on behalf of both Elisha and God, just as he did previously. Thus, Naaman gave without question. He also freely gave two of his servants to help carry the tremendous loot of silver. Knowing that he had done an evil thing, Gehazi had the servants hide the silver in his house. As a gentile, Naaman showed himself more righteous than God’s representative. Gehazi defamed God with his lies and his greed.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">As God’s ambassador, walk with righteousness and integrity</span>. Like Gehazi, you are God’s ambassador (2 Cor. 5:22). You also represent God’s light (Matt. 5:14). Thus, as an example to others, you are called upon to be holy (1 Pet. 1:16). God also calls upon you to be blameless and righteous: “so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless until the day of Christ; having been filled with the fruit of righteousness which comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.” (Phil. 1:11). Do your actions reflect fairly upon Jesus’ righteousness?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Gehazi violated God’s Tenth Commandment against coveting</span>. By longing for something that did not belong to him, Gehazi violated God’s Tenth Commandment: “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife or his male servant or his female servant or his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.” (Ex. 20:17; 5:21). Paul is clear that this Commandment still applies to believers. It is included in Jesus’ command that you love your neighbor as yourself: “For this, ‘you shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall not steal, <em>you shall not covet</em>,’ and if there is any other commandment, it is summed up in this saying, ‘you shall love your neighbor as yourself.”’ (Ro. 13:9). If you long for things that do not belong to you, you also have violated God’s Tenth Commandment.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Gehazi also violated God’s Second Commandment against idolatry</span>. Because money was what Gehazi longed for, it was also his idol. Paul defines greed as a form of idolatry: “Therefore consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, <em>and greed, which amounts to idolatry</em>.” (Col. 3:5). “But immorality or any impurity or greed must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints;” (Eph. 5:3). Thus, if you give into covetousness, whatever you covet is your idol.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Gehazi also violated God’s Third Commandment with his lies and his theft</span>. Gehazi’s actions were particularly offensive to God because it cast a shadow over God and Elisha. To a critic, Elisha’s ministry would appear no better than the false prophet who tried to fleece God’s people for money. Moreover, by falsely swearing in God’s name, Gehazi took the Lord’s name in vain and violated the Third Commandment: “You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.” (Ex. 20:7; 5:11). ‘“You shall not swear falsely by My name, so as to profane the name of your God; I am the LORD.”’ (Lev. 19:12). By stealing gifts offered to God, he also profaned God’s holy name: ‘That I not be full and deny You and say, ‘Who is the LORD?’ Or that I not be in want and steal, And profane the name of my God.” (Prov. 30:9). Does your conduct honor God?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Guard yourself against greed and covetousness, which can defile you before God</span>. Jesus warned believers to stay vigilant to guard their heats against greed and any form of covetousness: “Then He said to them, ‘<em>Beware, and be on your guard against every form of greed</em>; for not even when one has an abundance does his life consist of his possessions.”’ (Lk. 12:15). Coveting, like the other Ten Commandments, is a sin of the heart that defiles you: “For from within, <em>out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts</em>, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, <em>deeds of coveting</em> <em>and</em> wickedness, <em>as well as</em> deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride <em>and</em> foolishness. All these evil things proceed from within and <em>defile the man</em>.” (Mk. 7:21-23). “A man with an evil eye hastens after wealth and does not know that want will come upon him.” (Prov. 28:22). Thus, if you covet and refuse to repent, you are defiling yourself before God.</p></li>

<p>7. <span class="underline">Repentance: God Also Expects You to Repent When You Sin</span>. 2 Kgs. 5:25-27.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Gehazi’s lies to Elisha to cover up his sins and receives God’s judgment</span>. When Gehazi returned, Elisha first tested his heart to see if he would confess his sins. When Gehazi lied to cover up his sins, God judged him through Elisha by infecting him with Naaman’s leprosy: “<em><sup>25 </sup>But he went in and stood before his master. And Elisha said to him, ‘Where have you been, Gehazi?’ And he said, ‘Your servant went nowhere</em>.’ <sup>26 </sup><em>Then he said to him, ‘Did not my heart go with you, when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Is it a time to receive money and to receive clothes and olive groves and vineyards and sheep and oxen and male and female servants? <sup>27 </sup>Therefore, the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever.’ So he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow</em>.” (2 Kgs. 5:25-27). Elisha tested Gehazi by asking him where he had been (2 Kgs. 5:25). This was similar to when God asked Adam “where are you?” (Gen. 3:9). In both cases, God knew where the person was physically. Yet, in both cases, God either directly or indirectly through His prophet asked a rhetorical question to ask where the person was spiritually. In both cases, the questions were meant to give the sinner a chance to repent. In both cases, the sinners exhibited stupidity to think that their sins could be hidden from God or His representative. In both cases, the sinners were spiritually blind to their sins. In both cases, God was forced to judge the sinners.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Coveting can turn your heart away from God</span>. Solomon was the wisest man alive (1 Kgs. 4:30). Yet, he coveted first wealth and then women. His coveting lead him to take 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kgs. 11:3). His lusts and his pagan wives then turned his heart away from God (1 Kgs. 11:4). He then began to serve other gods and did evil in God’s eyes (1 Kgs. 11:5-6). Do the lusts of the flesh rule over you?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Ananias and Saphira’s coveting caused them to steal and then lie about it</span>. Like Gehazi, Ananias and Saphira provide another example of how coveting can lead to theft against God (Mal. 3:8-10). The coveting of money overcame both Ananias and Saphira by causing them to withhold tithes from their church (Acts 5:1-3). Their coveting not only caused them to break the Eighth Commandment against theft, their coveting also caused them to break the Ninth Commandment against lying. God then struck them both dead as an example for the Church (Acts 5:4-10). If you seek God first, you have no reason to worry about money or anything else. He will provide for you (Matt. 6:33). Does your love of your money make it hard for you to give back a part of God’s money?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Coveting leads to the temptation to use lies and deceit</span>. Like Gehazi, if you covet a life filled with wealth, you may face many types of temptations to lie or use deceit. This can include holding back on your tithes, underreporting your taxable income and stealing from employers, clients, or others. If you give into covetousness, you will also face other similar temptations. You may also face temptations to gamble or argue with your spouse. Studies show that the most common thing to happen to couples after winning the lottery is to get a divorce. If anyone loves these “things of the world,” “the love for the Father is not in him.” (1 Jo. 2:15). Is your heart filled with a love of money?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">No sin can be hidden from God</span>. God gave Elisha prophetic sight of Gehazi’s evil acts (2 Kgs. 5:26). He knew that Gehazi felt entitled to profit off of his ministry for God. He even knew that Gehazi planned to buy a vineyard, animals, and servants with his stolen monies (2 Kgs. 5:26). No sin can be hidden from God (Job 11:11; Ps. 139:1-4).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Gehazi received the fruit of his labors</span>. As his judgment, Gehazi received the same leprosy that previously infected Naaman. In an instant, his skin was white from full blown leprosy (2 Kgs. 5:27). He had gone out to receive something from Naaman (2 Kgs. 5:20). He returned and received Naaman’s leprosy as the fruit of his labors. Now, the evil inside of Gehazi was visible for all to see. If he ever got married as a leper, he would also doom any future children to being lepers as well. Finally, he would no longer have the privilege and honor of serving Elisha and witnessing God’s many miracles.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The love of money leads to many types of grief and sadness</span>. Gehazi faced the sadness of living a life as a leper. This included lonely isolation. Although money is not inherently evil, the love of money is an evil that leads to many kinds of grief (1 Tim. 6:9-10). Even if you have eternal salvation through Christ, God promises “curses” or earthly discipline in the form of hardships for those who reject His Covenant and choose to submit to Satan’s covetousness (Lev. 26:14-37; Dt. 27:15-26; 28:15-68). This can include addictions (Ro. 1:24-33). God disciplines you when you are willingly wayward in your walk because He loves you and wants to guide you back with His rod (Heb. 12:6). Are you using His grace as a license to covet more? (Rom. 6:15).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God promises to punish unrepentant covetousness</span>. God is slow to anger and wants no one to perish (2 Pet. 3:9). Yet, He is a consuming fire of <em>righteousness</em> (Heb. 12:28-29). In Proverbs, Solomon warned from personal experience that God will ultimately punish those who give into covetousness and then refuse to repent of it: “A faithful man will have many blessings, but one in a hurry to get rich will not go unpunished.” (Prov. 28:20). Like the other Commandments, the penalty for coveting is death (Jam. 1:14-15; <strong>Heb. 10:28</strong>). A coveter who has not repented and accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior is not only cursed to struggle and lead a life of desperation, that person is also disqualified from entering heaven (1 Cor. 6:9-10; Eph. 5:5; see also Rev. 2:14, 20).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Repent when God exposes your sins</span>. Unlike Gehazi, God calls upon you to repent when He exposes your sins. When you repent, He is faithful to forgive you (1 Jo. 1:9).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>efore Me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel.’” (1 Kgs. 2:4). When the Jews walked with Him, God also promised to cause their enemies to fear them: “I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.” (Ex. 23:27). ‘“This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples everywhere under the heavens, who, when they hear the report of you, will tremble and be in anguish because of you.’” (Dt. 2:25). You also never need to fear your enemies when you act in Spirit-led obedience and do God’s will. If you are serving God, do you trust Him to protect you? If not, you may act foolishly like Zedekiah.</p>
