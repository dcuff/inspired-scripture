<p>The Sixth Commandment – Ten Lessons Regarding God’s Prohibition Against Murder</p>
<p>“You Shall Not Murder.” (Ex. 20:13; Dt. 5:17).</p>
<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span>: The prohibition against murder is something that all societies agree to. It is part of God’s Law that is written on our hearts: “For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves, in that they show the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness and their thoughts alternately accusing or else defending them . . .” (Ro. 2:14-15; same Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10, 16; 2 Cor. 3:3). The Bible, however, has much more to teach us about murder. God used murders to deliver His Laws to show that we all need mercy and grace and that God can forgive even the worst of our sins. Jesus expanded the definition of murder to include hatred, anger, and even name calling to show us that we all are guilty under the Law and in need of repentance. The Bible also teaches that not all killings are the same. Intentional and unintentional killings must be judged differently using standards of due process and proportionality for punishment. The Bible also teaches the some types of state-sponsored killings are permitted. These include capital punishment and certain deaths caused during wars or when a law enforcement official enforces the law. Yet, the Bible also teachings that some kinds of killings might be ordered or allowed but still violate God’s law. These include the killings of noncombatants during war and abortion. Finally, the Bible teaches you to repent of your hated and anger toward others. If others have shown anger and hatred toward you, forgive them so that God can forgive you. As you read this study, if Holy Spirit reveals any sins in your life, repent of your sins and conform to God’s will for your life.</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">To Show Their Need For Mercy and Grace, God Used Murderers as His Greatest Prophets</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Moses’ murder of an Egyptian</span>. Moses did not begin his life as a saint. Instead, he was a fugitive from the law after committing murder: “Now it came about in those days, when Moses had grown up, that he went out to his brethren and looked on their hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his brethren. So he looked this way and that, and when he saw there was no one around, he struck down the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.” (Ex. 2:11-12). “On the following day he appeared to them as they were fighting together, and he tried to reconcile them in peace, saying, ‘Men, you are brethren, why do you injure one another?’ But the one who was injuring his neighbor pushed him away, saying, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us? You do not mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’” (Acts 7:26-28). Why would God select someone who had murdered to give the law against murder?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Moses was the most humble man because he knew the price of his sins before God.</span> The Bible says that Moses was the most humble man on the planet (Nu. 12:13). Moses had no reason to believe that God selected him because of his righteousness. He has had reason to be prideful. From the Law, he knew that the penalty for his sins was death.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">David’s murder of Uriah</span>. God said that David was “a man after My heart, who will do my will.” (Acts 13:22). God also used David to write many of the Psalms and to unite the Jews. Yet, David also was not a saint. While Davis sent his troops to battle the Ammonites he slept with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite (2 Sam. 11:1-4). After she told David that she was pregnant, David first tried to deceive Uriah by sending him home from the war to stay with his wife (2 Sam. 11:5-8). When Uriah refused to stay with his wife while his troops were in battle, David then tried to deceive Uriah about the pregnancy by getting him drunk to entice him to go to his wife (2 Sam. 11:9-13). When that plan of deceit failed, David tried to cover up his adultery by writing a letter to his commander Joab to order that Uriah be sent to his death on the front lines of battle: “Place Uriah in the front line of the fiercest battle and withdraw from him, so that he may be struck down and die.” (2 Sam. 11: 14). The Bible records that the Messiah would come from the line of David: “There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace, <em>on the throne of David and over his kingdom</em>, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness from then on and forevermore. The zeal of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts will accomplish this.” (Is. 9:7; 2 Sam. 7:16; Ps. 132:17). Jesus fulfilled this prophesy by being a descendant of David (Matt. 1:1; Ro. 1:3). Why would God pick a murderer for the line of the Messiah? If God could use David, an adulterer and a murderer, is there any sin of yours that is too great for God to forgive? Is there any past sin that should hold you back from service?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Paul’s murder of multiple Christians</span>. Paul also killed and imprisoned Christians: “I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and putting both men and women into prisons.” (Acts 22:4). “But Saul began ravaging the church, entering house after house, and dragging off men and women, he would put them in prison.” (Acts 8:3). “For you have heard of my former manner of life in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it;” (Gal. 1:13). God selected him to write most of the New Testament because Paul would know he did not deserve this honor: “For I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.” (Col. 15:9). Paul also would not have fully understood universal sin and the need for God’s mercy and grace unless he knew how much he needed it himself (Ro. 3:20). If God could use Paul for His will, is there any reason why He cannot use you?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <span class="underline">Any Time that You Have Had Anger in Your Heart, You Too Have Committed Murder</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Anger, hatred, and even name calling is murder in God’s eyes</span>. Satan was the first to sow the seeds of murder and hatred within mankind (Ez. 28:14-16). According to Jesus, whoever murders or even hates another is under Satan’s influence and is guilty of murder in God’s eyes: “You have heard that the ancients were told, ‘You shall not commit murder’ and ‘Whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court.’ But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court; and whoever says to his brother, ‘You good-for-nothing,’ shall be guilty before the supreme court; and whoever says, ‘You fool,’ shall be guilty <em>enough to go</em> into the fiery hell.” (Matt. 5:21-22). “Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.” (1 Jo. 3:15). Have you ever been angry with someone? Have you ever hated someone? Have you ever called someone a fool, an idiot, or some other similar insult? Can you say before God that you have never violated His Commandment against murder?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">If you have broken one Commandment, you have broken them all</span>. “For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one <em>point</em>, he has become guilty of all.” (Jam. 2:10). Even if you have never hated someone, but you have broken some other Commandment, are you in need of God’s mercy and grace from His punishment for murder (Ro. 3:20).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3. <span class="underline">The Penalty for Murder is Death</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The punishment for intentional murder is capital punishment</span>. Although some Christians believe that capital punishment is immoral, it is the punishment that God proscribed for intentional murder: “Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man his blood shall be shed, for in the image of God He made man.” (Gen 9:6). “He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death.” (Ex. 21:12). “If a man takes the life of any human being, he shall surely be put to death.” (Lev. 24:17). “If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death . . . .” (Nu. 35:30).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">For the unsaved, the punishment for murder is also eternal death</span>. As set forth above, Jesus expanded the types of actions that fall under this crime. He also expanded the punishment. All unsaved murderers and people filled with anger and hatred towards others: “shall be guilty <em>enough to go</em> into the fiery hell.” (Matt. 5:22; 15:18-19; Gal. 5:21; 1 Jo. 3:15).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">There is nothing that you can pay to God to forgive your murder</span>. “Moreover, you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall surely be put to death.” (Nu. 35:31). Besides accepting in faith what Jesus did for you at the cross, is there anything that you could offer God to pay for your murder, anger, or hatred towards others?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <span class="underline">Unrepentant Hatred or Murder May Also “Hinder” Your Prayers</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s many warnings about the “hindered” prayers of sinners</span>. For unrepentant sinners, God warns: “So when you spread out your hands in prayer, I will hide My eyes from you; yes, even though you multiply prayers, I will not listen. Your hands are covered with blood.” (Is. 1:15). “But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you so that He does not hear. For your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken falsehood, your tongue mutters wickedness.” (Is. 59:2-3). “We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but he does listen to anyone who worships him and does his will.” (Jo. 9:31; Prov. 15:29; 8:9; Ps. 66:18). If you are filled with unrepentant anger or hatred, your prayers will be “hindered” (1 Pet. 3:7).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">A person who has wronged another in secret is cursed</span>. When Cain murdered his brother Abel, God cursed the land that he tried to cultivate (Gen. 4:8-15). This same curse applies to anyone else who murders or harms a person in secret: ‘“Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret’… ‘Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to strike down an innocent person.’” (Dt. 27:24-25). If you have hurt another person in secret, you cannot expect that your sins will go unnoticed before God (Heb. 4:13; Jer. 16:17).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">A unaddressed murder will also defile the land</span>. Murder also defiles the land (Nu. 35:33-34; Ps. 106:38; Ho. 4:1-3). A defiled land can bring about famine, drought, disease, and economic decline. The western world cannot embrace violence and expect to be blessed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5. <span class="underline">God’s Law Requires that the Punishment Reflect the Mental State of the Killer</span>. Our modern laws distinguish between intentional and unintentional crimes. Meditate on the following verses, for who desires credit for the laws that we celebrate in the Western world.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Assault with a deadly weapon resulting in death is a capital crime</span>. God commands: “But if he struck him down with an iron object, so that he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. If he struck him down with a stone in the hand, by which he will die, and <em>as a result</em> he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death. Or if he struck him with a wooden object in the hand, by which he might die, and <em>as a result</em> he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.” (Nu. 35:16-18).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Assault with hatred or while lying in wait resulting in death is also a capital crime</span>. God also commands: “If he pushed him of hatred, or threw something at him lying in wait and <em>as a result</em> he died, or if he struck him down with his hand in enmity, and <em>as a result</em> he died, the one who struck him shall surely be put to death, he is a murderer . . .” (Nu. 35:20-21).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">A person who commits manslaughter (second degree murder) shall not be put to death</span>. “He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death. But if he did not lie in wait for him, but God let him fall into his hand, then I will appoint you a place to which he may flee.” (Ex. 21:12-13). A person was entitled to refuge confined to a city of refuge if he or she killed someone “if he pushed him suddenly without enmity, or threw something at him without lying in wait, or with any deadly object of stone, and without seeing it dropped on him so that he died, while he was not his enemy nor seeking his injury . . .” (Nu. 35:22-23).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">A person who kills in self-defense is not guilty under the law</span>. God further commanded that: “If the thief is caught while breaking in and is struck so that he dies, there will be no bloodguiltiness on his account.” (Ex. 22:2). Jesus commands that we turn cheek when we are injured by another (Matt. 5:39). God’s law, however, suggests that a person who kills while defending his property and presumably oneself has not committed a crime under God’s law. Thus, under some circumstances, Christians may have the right to bear guns to defend their homes and families. Where would you draw the line between Jesus’ words and the law of the Old Testament?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The criminally insane should be treated differently</span>. Many people cringe at the insanity defense available in Western countries. Yet, God’s law distinguished between intentional and unintentional killings. If an insane person kills without the knowledge between right and wrong, it would not be proper under God’s law to execute such a person.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6. <span class="underline">God’s Law Requires “Due Process” For Those Accused of Murder</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Capital punishment requires at least two witnesses</span>. “If anyone kills a person, the murderer shall be put to death <em>at the evidence of witnesses, but no person shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness</em>.” (Nu. 35:30). “On the evidence of two witnesses or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death; <em>he shall not be put to death on the evidence of one witness</em>.” (Dt. 17:6). The Catholic Church teaches that Capital punishment is morally wrong. Yet, this teaching is not consistent with the Bible. Many Protestant Churches endorse state laws requiring capital punishment when a murder is committed with “special circumstances,” but not with the testimony of two or more witnesses. This teaching also is not consistent with the Bible. Capital punishment is maligned because of innocent deaths based upon the faulty testimony of only one witness. Would these problems exist if governments used God’s standards of due process for capital crimes?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Capital punishment requires a trial by jury</span>. In the Old Testament, a family or tribal member who tried to avenge the death of another family or tribal member was called a “blood avenger.” In cases involving death, God required that an impartial jury in a neutral “city of refuge” was to judge between the blood avenger and the accused: “[T]hen <em>the congregation</em> shall judge between the slayer and the blood avenger according to these ordinances. <em>The congregation</em> shall deliver the manslayer from the hand of the blood avenger, and the congregation shall restore him to his city of refuge to which he fled. . .” (Nu. 35:24-35). The Sixth Amendment to the US Constitution, like the Sixth Commandment, requires the right to an impartial jury for a criminal offense: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defense.” People celebrate this as a great achievement of secular mankind. But where is true credit due?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>7. <span class="underline">Many of Those Who Implement Government Sanctioned Killings Have No Guilt</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">A soldier or law enforcement officer is God’s appointed avenger</span>. Vengeance belongs to God alone (Dt. 32:35; Ps. 94:1-2, 16, 23; Rom. 12:17, 19). Yet, God uses government officials to carry out His vengeance: “For rulers are not a cause of fear for good behavior, but for evil. Do you want to have no fear of authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from the same; for it is a minister of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, be afraid; for it does not bear the sword for nothing; for it is a minister of God, an avenger who brings wrath on the one who practices evil.” (Rom. 13:3-4; 1 Pet. 2:14). If a soldier is commanded to kill in time of war or if a police officer shoots to stop another killing, either person is God’s appointed “avenger.” Neither has committed murder. “ Joab . . . shed the blood of war in peace.” (1 Kings 2:5-6). When a group of soldiers asked Jesus what they needed to do to be righteous, Jesus said nothing about putting down their weapons. He instead told them to be content with their wages: “Some soldiers were questioning him, saying, ‘And what about us, what shall we do?’ And he said to them, ‘Do not take money from anyone by force, or accuse anyone falsely, and be content with your wages.’” (Lk. 3:14). Many veterans sadly carry guilt believing that they have murdered others in combat. The high rates of homelessness, drug abuse, and other problems amongst veterans indicate that this is a serious problem. Yet, if the Church properly taught God’s Law, they would not carry guilt.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">A soldier must fight if his or her objections to a war are only political</span>. God warns that: “Every person is to be in subjection to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those which exist are established by God. Therefore whoever resists authority has opposed the ordinance of God; and they who have opposed will receive condemnation upon themselves.” (Ro. 13:1-2). If a soldier does not agree with the politics behind a war after voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces, the soldier must still be obedient.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The killing of noncombatants is not allowed, even when state sponsored</span>. In the Old Testament, God ordered the Jews to clear the Promised Land of the ungodly, including women and children: “When the LORD your God brings you into the land which you are entering to take possession of it, and clears away many nations before you, the Hittites, the Gir'gashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Per'izzites, the Hivites, and the Jeb'usites . . . then <em>you must utterly destroy them</em>; you shall make no covenant with them, and show no mercy to them.” (Dt. 7:1-2; 7:16; 20:17; Nu. 31:7-8; Josh. 11:10-14). These commandments, however, were special commandments that only applied to the clearing of the land of Israel. Their only application today applies in the spiritual context of rooting out sin. The laws previously quoted for intentional an unintentional crimes, normally prohibited the killing of non-combatants like children because they were innocent of any crime: “You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people . . .” (Lev. 19:18). During the holocaust, Hitler killed 6 million Jews, including 1 million children. The Germans should have refused to follow human law when Hitler’s law broke God’s law: “We must obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29). Thus, there is a limit to when a soldier must obey the commands of a government. A soldier cannot object to the politics of a war. Yet, a soldier must object to the intentional killing of non-combatants, like women and children.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>8. <span class="underline">Sacrificing Children for the Promise of a Better Life Is Not Sanctioned Under God’s Law</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The prohibition against killing children</span>. God makes each child within the womb (Ps. 139:13). Thus, child sacrifices to the gods of that time (i.e., Molech) were expressly prohibited: “You shall not give any of your offspring to offer them to Molech, nor shall you profane the name of your God; I am the LORD.” (Lev. 18:21). ‘“I will also set My face against that man and will cut him off from among his people, because he has given some of his offspring to Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary and to profane My holy name.”’ (Lev. 20:3-4). Today, the god of our world is ourselves (Is. 47:8-10). Would sacrificing an unborn child to meet our own selfish desires be any less of an abomination in God’s eyes?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">A society that fails to stop child sacrifices will also be cursed</span>. God warns: ‘“If the people of the land, however, should ever disregard that man when he gives any of his offspring to Molech, so as not to put him to death, then I Myself will set My face against that man and against his family, and I will cut off from among their people both him and all those who play the harlot after him, by playing the harlot after Molech.”’ (Lev. 20:5). He also warns that He punished the people of Canaan for their immoral practices (Lev. 18:24-29). Their curse dated back to the curse against Noah’s son Ham (Gen. 9:24-25). He also warned the Jews that He would curse the land if they sacrificed their children: “And shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with the blood.” (Ps. 106:38). God does not desire that any nation or any person perish (2 Pet. 3:9). He spared the people of Nineveh after they repented (Jonah 3:10). Yet, not wanting to punish an unrepentant nation doesn’t mean that God won’t eventually do so. God repeatedly judged Israel when it failed to follow His rules. Since 1973, Americans have aborted more than 50 million babies. Should we think our nation is exempt from God’s discipline if He repeatedly disciplined the Jews?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>9. <span class="underline">Repent of Your Sins of Hatred, Anger, or Murder</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Give thanks that Jesus Has Paid the Price for Your Sins</span>. Without the shedding of blood, sins cannot be forgiven: “without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.” (Heb. 9:22; Lev. 17:11). The blood also had to be from an animal “without defect.” (Lev. 1:3, 10; 3:1; 22:20; Ex. 12:5; Dt. 15:21; 17:1). Christ offered a one-time blood sacrifice for all our sins. “For <em>by one offering</em> He has perfected <em>for all time</em> those who are sanctified.” (Heb. 10:14). “Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood.” (Rev. 1:5). If God was willing to accept the sacrifice of animals on our behalf, we have no reason to doubt Christ’s ability to atone for even the worst sinners, including murders: “how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?” (Heb. 9:14). Is there any guilt remaining from any confessed sin in your life that is holding you back from service? If so that guilt is from the devil and not from God (1 Jo. 1:9).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Renew your mind and release any anger or hatred in your life</span>. God is not just the God of the Spirit, He is also “the God of the flesh.” (Jer. 32:27; John 17:2). He made us new creations (2 Cor. 5:17). He can also wash our flesh of any iniquity (Ps. 51:1-3, 7). We must first read the Word to know our sins (Eph. 5:26). If we confess and repent of “unrighteousness,” God is faithful to forgive us (1 Jo. 1:9; Jo. 15:3; 1 Cor. 6:11). We must then renew our minds every day to release any anger or hatred that may form in our lives (Rom. 12:1-2). Does anger easy boil up in your life? If so, ask God in prayer to remove this from your life.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Reconcile with any aggrieved brother or sister before you go to God in prayer</span>. If you have hatred toward someone else, Jesus says that you must first make restitution with the person you have wronged before you go to God. “Therefore if you are presenting your offering at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your offering there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your offering.” (Matt. 5:23-24). Is there anyone you have shown hatred or anger toward that you have not apologized to?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>10. <span class="underline">Forgive Those Who Have Hated or Murmured Against You or Killed a Loved One</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Forgiveness allows you to be forgiven</span>. If someone sins against you, Jesus says that you must forgive that person “up to seventy times seven” times (Matt. 18:22). If a believer does not forgive another believer, God will not forgive the believer: ‘“I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave, in the same way that I had mercy on you?’ And his lord, moved with anger, handed him over to the torturers until he should repay all that was owed him. My heavenly Father will also do the same to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart.” (Matt. 18:32-35). Have you refused to forgive someone who hurt you?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Pray for those who persecute you</span>. What must we do if another person is angry with us and will not accept our apologies or efforts to resolve the situation? We must pray for them: “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.” (Matt. 5:43-44).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Israel, for it is a heave offering; and it shall be a heave offering from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their heave offering to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>29 </sup>“The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, that in them they may be anointed and ordained. <sup>30 </sup>For seven days the one of his sons who is priest in his stead shall put them on when he enters the tent of meeting to minister in the holy place.” (Ex. 29:26-30). The commandments for the “waive offering” are repeated 12 times in Leviticus and Numbers (<a href="http://www.searchgodsword.org/desk/?query=le+7:30,34"><span class="underline">Lev. 7:30-34</span></a>; <a href="http://www.searchgodsword.org/desk/?query=le+8:27"><span class="underline">8:26-27</span></a>; <a href="http://www.searchgodsword.org/desk/?query=le+9:21"><span class="underline">9:21</span></a>; <a href="http://www.searchgodsword.org/desk/?query=le+10:14,15"><span class="underline">10:14-15</span></a>; <a href="http://www.searchgodsword.org/desk/?query=le+23:10,15,20"><span class="underline">23:10; 15-20</span></a>; 23:10; <a href="http://www.searchgodsword.org/desk/?query=nu+6:20"><span class="underline">Nu. 6:20</span></a>; 8:11-13; <a href="http://www.searchgodsword.org/desk/?query=nu+18:11,18,26-29"><span class="underline">18:11, 18, 26-29</span></a>). The waive offering showed that the priest was both bound by and connected to God. Depending upon the English translation used, this offering included either the right “thigh” (NASB/NIV) or the right “shoulder” (KJV), both amongst the strongest muscles in the body. The priest also gave the meat of the breasts to the Lord (Lev. 7:31-32; 9:20; 10:12-15; Nu. 18:18). The breast is also a symbol of love, like the bond between a nursing mother and her baby. Because Christ loved us, He gave both His strength and His life for us out of love (Ro. 5:8; Gal. 2:20; Jo. 3:16). By eating these two portions of the animal in fellowship with God, the priest acknowledged that his life, love, and strength had come from God. Conversely, the priest acknowledged that he would give his life, love, and strength to God. <strong>Yet, at a later time, the wicked priests refused to follow this rule</strong> (1 Sam. 2:12-14). This symbolized their lack of love for the people that they served. If you are searching for the strength to do something, you must give up your own strength and turn to Christ through whom all things are possible: “I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.” (Phil. 4:13). Do you have a love in your heart to help others? Do you rely upon your own intellect to get through a difficult situation? Or, do you rely upon God?</p>
<p><span class="underline">Be accountable</span>. The ordination of the priests took place in front of the Tent of Meeting for all to see (Ex. 29:4, 10). This means that the priests would be held accountable to others. Believers are also encouraged to be accountable toward others. For this reason, believers are admonished not to forsake the fellowship of other believers. “[L]et us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.” (Heb. 10:24-25). Floating in and out of a large mega church does not bring true accountability. Are you accountable to a small group of other believers?</p>
<p>7. <span class="underline">Seek Out Constant Fellowship and Communion with Christ</span>. Ex. 29:31-46.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The fellowship meal - to “dine” with Jesus, search for Him with all your heart</span>. A final and important part of the ordination process involved eating a fellowship meal at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting: “<sup>31 </sup><em>You shall take the ram of ordination and boil its flesh in a holy place. <sup>32 </sup>Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram and the bread that is in the basket, at the doorway of the tent of meeting. <sup>33 </sup>Thus they shall eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration; but a layman shall not eat them, because they are holy. <sup>34 </sup>If any of the flesh of ordination or any of the bread remains until morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy</em>.” (Ex. 29:31-46). Portions of these animal sacrificed were offered as a “food” offering to God (Lev. 3:11, 16). With other offerings, the burned animal or grain was offered as a sweet aroma to the Lord. Some commentaries suggest that we should not take the food reference literally. But this is exactly what Jesus promised to the believers at the Church of Laodicea who responded to his knocking at the door of their hearts to Him (Rev. 3:20). The commandment for the priests to eat at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (Ex. 29:32) foreshadowed Jesus’ offer at the door of your heart to “dine” with Him. Yet, to allow Jesus to dine with you, you must first seek Him with all your heart: “How blessed are those who observe His testimonies, who seek Him with all <em>their</em> heart.” (Ps. 119:2). “You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.” (Jer. 29:13). “But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul.” (Dt. 4:29). Jesus also revealed that this is the greatest Commandment: “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.” (Matt. 22:37). Are you fulfilling this Commandment?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Don’t delay in seeking Jesus’ fellowship</span>. The instructions to the priest also included a warning not to delay eating the sacrifice until morning (Ex. 29:34). This commandment is repeated three times in the book of Leviticus (Lev. 7:14-15; 19:6-8; 22:29-30). Christ rose before the third day so that His body would not be corrupted (Acts 2:27; Ps. 16:10). We can therefore eat the Communion that He offers from His body because it is holy. By telling the people not to delay until morning, God was also telling them not to delay in giving the best of their time, talent, and treasure for Him. At one point a disciple said to Jesus: “‘Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.’ But Jesus said to him, ‘Follow Me, and allow the dead to bury their own dead.’” (Matt. 8:21-23). We cannot wait to get our personal affairs in order before we go and serve the Lord. Are you being disobedient to a calling in your life by waiting until a time you think is convenient?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Seek out Jesus every day</span>. God’s instructions to the priests conclude with instructions to offer daily sacrifices to God: “<sup>35 </sup><em>Thus you shall do to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded you; you shall ordain them through seven days. <sup>36 </sup>Each day you shall offer a bull as a sin offering for atonement, and you shall purify the altar when you make atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to consecrate it. <sup>37 </sup>For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar and consecrate it; then the altar shall be most holy, and whatever touches the altar shall be holy. <sup>38 </sup>Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two one year old lambs each day, continuously. <sup>39 </sup>The one lamb you shall offer in the morning and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight; <sup>40 </sup>and there shall be one-tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of beaten oil, and one-fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering with one lamb. <sup>41 </sup>The other lamb you shall offer at twilight, and shall offer with it the same grain offering and the same drink offering as in the morning, for a soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>42 </sup>It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the doorway of the tent of meeting before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, where I will meet with you, to speak to you there.”</em> (Ex. 29:35-42). The priest were told offer a sin offering “every day.” (Ex. 29:36). According to Christ, you should also pick up your cross to follow Him daily (Lk. 9:23). Do you have time each day that you devote to Him?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Make your life a “drink offering” in communion with Christ</span>. Part of the daily sacrifices included a “drink offering.” (Ex. 29:40; Lev. 23:1; Nu. 15:5, 7, 10). Jesus is the vine of life that you drink, and the wine symbolizes His blood (Jo. 6:53). In handing His cup to the disciples, Jesus said: “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.” (Mk. 14:24). After drinking His cup in communion, you in turn can make your own “spiritual sacrifice” by making your life a drink offering to Him. Paul at one time compared his life sacrifice to a drink offering: “even if I am being poured out as <em>a drink offering</em> upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my <em>joy</em> with you”. (Phil. 2:17; same, 2 Tim. 4:6). In this context, wine is a symbol of joy or happiness (Ps. 104:14(f); Ecc. 9:7). Do people see the joy of the Lord radiating out of your life?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The need for a better sacrifice</span>. While these sacrifices complied with God’s law, they could not by themselves take away sins. They could only cover the sins of the people: “Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, <em>which can never take away sins</em>. . . ” (Heb. 10:11). “For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near.” (Heb. 10:1). Thus, the sacrifices of the Old Testament were imperfect. Also, when the Romans destroyed the second temple 30 years after Christ’s death, they left the Jews without a way to comply with God’s sacrificial law. The Jews needed a long-term solution.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The one-time blood sacrifice of Christ</span>. Christ offered a solution to the need for a one-time sacrifice for all: “For <em>by one offering</em> He has perfected <em>for all time</em> those who are sanctified.” (Heb. 10:14). “Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and released us from our sins by His blood.” (Rev. 1:5). If God was willing to accept the sacrifice of animals to atone for sin, you have no reason to doubt Christ’s ability to atone for even the worst of your sins: “how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?” (Heb. 9:14). Are you letting any of your old sins hold you back from serving God?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s goal is to dwell with you in fellowship</span>. God concludes by reminding Moses that His goal is to dwell with His people: “<em><sup>43 </sup>I will meet there with the sons of Israel, and it shall be consecrated by My glory. <sup>44 </sup>I will consecrate the tent of meeting and the altar; I will also consecrate Aaron and his sons to minister as priests to Me. <sup>45 </sup>I will dwell among the sons of Israel and will be their God. <sup>46 </sup>They shall know that I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> their God who brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them; I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> their God</em>.” (Ex. 29:43-46). Your worship should give thanks that God desires to dwell with you. His Spirit dwells in you, and you will dwell with Him in heaven.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>. 6:6; Heb. 13:5). Thus, we are to do all things “without grumbling or disputing.” (Phil. 2:14). In “everything,” we are to “give thanks.” (1 Thess. 5:18). Have you repented about your complaints regarding what you don’t have? Do you give thanks for everything, even when times are bad?</p>
<p><strong>(6)</strong> <span class="underline">To fight covetousness, b<strong>e humble</strong></span><strong>. Like Satan, another reason for coveting is if you feel entitled to more than what you have. To keep yourself humble, praise God for all your gifts (1 Cor. 9:15; Col. 3:17; 3:23). Every good and perfect gift in your life comes from above, not from you (Jam. 1:17). Are you giving credit to God for your accomplishments?</strong></p>
<p>(7) <span class="underline">To fight covetousness, be in constant prayer for yourself and for others trapped in addiction</span>. “Every word of God is tested; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.” (Prov. 30:5; 2 Sam. 22:31). You can take refuge in God when you submit to Him in obedience and in prayer: “Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving.” (Col. 4:2). Ask God to give you what is holy and what will satisfy you: “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will <em>your</em> heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?” (Lk. 11:13). Seek God’s wisdom with the same intensity that you work for money and He will bless you with wisdom: “For if you cry for discernment, lift your voice for understanding; if you seek her as silver and search for her as for hidden treasures; then you will discern the fear of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and discover the knowledge of God.” (Prov. 2:3-5). God’s wisdom is more rewarding than jewels: “For wisdom is better than jewels; and all desirable things cannot compare with her.” (Prov. 8:11). “My fruit is better than gold, even pure gold, and my yield <em>better</em> than choicest silver.” (Prov. 8:19). Are you praying for God’s shield of protection and His wisdom?</p>
<p>10. <span class="underline">God Has Blessings For You If You Choose His Covenant over the Devil’s Covetousness</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Compliance with the Ten Commandments brings the blessings of God’s covenant</span>. Your salvation in Christ is a “free gift” that cannot be earned (Rom. 6:23). Yet, separate and apart from your salvation through Christ, God promises conditional “blessings” for those who follow His law with the right motivation: “<em>If</em> you will give earnest heed to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, <em>I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for I, the LORD, am your healer</em>.” (Ex. 15:26; Lev. 26:3-13; Dt. 28:2-14). If you choose the covenant over covetousness, God promises to bless you in several ways:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">Your needs (not wants) will be met</span>. If the Jews followed God’s Law, He promised rain for the produce to grow (Lev. 26:3-5; Dt. 11:10-17; 32:1-3; 1 Ki. 18:41-46). He also promises to provide for you today if you trust Him (Matt. 6:25-34).</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">You will have God’s <em>Shalom</em> peace</span>. If the Jews followed God’s law, He also promised to give them peace (Lev. 26:6). If you follow the Law, you also can enjoy the <em>Shalom</em> peace of God that surpasses human understanding (Phil 4:7). Your conscience will also be clean (1 Pet. 3:21). “For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace.” (Ro. 8:6).</p>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">Enemies will not harm you</span>. If the Jews followed God’s law, He further promised victory over their enemies (Lev. 26:7-8; Ex. 23:22, Nu 10:9, 35; Isa. 54:17). A thief or enemy cannot steal your treasures if they are stored in heaven (Matt. 6:19-21).</p>
<p>(4) <span class="underline">You will bear the fruit and joy of the Spirit</span>. If the Jews followed God’s law, He also promised that the Jews would be fruitful and multiply (Lev. 26:9-10). Jesus also promised you an abundant life in the Spirit, not a life of misery (Jo. 10:10).</p>
<p>(5) <span class="underline">Your prayers will not be hindered</span>. If the Jews followed God’s law, He further promised to dwell with His people (Lev. 26:11). Today, the Holy Spirit dwells within you (1 Cor. 6:19). Your prayers will not be “hindered” when you obey (1 Pet. 3:7). “We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners, but he does listen to anyone who worships him and does his will.” (John 9:31; Prov. 15:29; Ps. 66:18; Prov. 28:9; Isa. 1:15).</p>
<p>(6) <span class="underline">God will break your bondage to sin and addictions.</span> If the Jews followed God’s law, He also promised to be their God, break them of their yoke of bondage and help them to walk erect (Lev. 26:12-13; Ex. 20:2). Through Jesus’ death, our bodies have been bought with a price (1 Cor. 6:19-20). If we have been freed from being slaves to sin, we instead should become a slave to righteousness (Rom. 6:17-18). Through faith in Christ, we have the strength to break any covetousness or addiction (Phil. 4:13).</p>
<p>(7) <span class="underline">God will reward you in other ways</span>. Obedience also brings other rewards and blessings: “If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.” (Jo. 13:17; Lev. 26:11). “But happy is he who keeps the law.” (Prov. 29:18). “Moreover, by them Your servant is warned; in keeping them there is great reward.” (Ps. 19:11). “Surely there is a reward for the righteous . . .” (Ps. 58:11). “But you, be strong and do not lose courage, for there is reward for your work.” (2 Chr. 15:7). “So keep the words of this covenant to do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.” (Dt. 29:9). “[B]e careful to do according to all the law . . . so that you may have success wherever you go.” (Josh. 1:7). “This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have success.” (Josh 1:8). “[H]e who sows righteousness gets a true reward.” (Prov. 11:18). “Walk in all the way that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess (<strong>Dt. 5:32-33;</strong> 4:40; Lev. 18:5). If you do not boast of your works, Jesus will also reward you (Matt. 6:4; 10:41; 1 Cor. 3:9-15; Rev. 2:26).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Choosing Covetousness, can also bring curses</span>. Even if you have eternal salvation through Christ, God promises “curses” or earthly discipline in the form of hardships for those who reject the covenant and choose to submit to the Devil’s covetousness (Lev. 26:14-37; Dt. 27:15-26; 28:15-68). This can include addictions to drugs, alcohol, gambling, pornography, and sex (Ro. 1:24-33). God disciplines you when you are willingly wayward in your walk because He loves you and wants to guide you back with His rod (Heb. 12:6). Are you using your grace as a license to covet and rebel against His laws? (Rom. 6:15).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Our nation will either be cursed or blessed for its choices</span>. Most westerners have grown accustomed to the notion that faith is something that has no place in public discourse. Yet, God warns that His blessings or curses await a nation depending upon whether it decides to accept His Law (Dt. 28). The curse or discipline can be lifted once a nation repents. This is exactly what happened after the people of Nineveh repented in response to Jonah’s warning (Jonah 3:1-10). Today, we see coveting promoted in every aspect of our society. This is also exactly what Paul predicted would happen: “But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good, treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; avoid such men as these.” (2 Tim. 3:1-15). God will punish a nation that openly embraces covetousness (Micah 2:2-3). Will you answer the call to restore in love those caught in the bondage of sin? (Gal. 6:1).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Your prayers for the nation can make a difference</span>. Your prayers can also help others trapped in addiction and rebellion. Moses’ prayers repeatedly saved the Jews after they rebelled against God (Ex. 32:11-14; Nu. 11:2; 14:18-22; Nu. 16:21-24). Are you praying for your nation and for those trapped in addictions? Will you fast for those trapped in addictions?</p></li>
