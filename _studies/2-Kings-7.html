<p>2 Kgs. 20: From Hezekiah’s Example, Seven Additional Things that God Offers to All Believers</p>
<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span>: In 2 Kings 19, God revealed seven blessings that He offers to faithful believers through His defeat of the Assyrian army. These include: (1) guidance, (2) encouragement, (3) protection, (4) deliverance, (5) answered prayers, (6) restoration, and (7) forgiveness. In 2 Kings 20, God used Hezekiah’s successes and his failures to reveal seven additional things that He offers to believers. These include: (1) healing, (2) a prolonged life, (3) His faithfulness, (4) His forgiveness (offered a second time), (5) conviction of sin, (6) discipline and (7) mercy and grace.</p>
<p><span class="underline">First</span>, when faced with a mortal illness before the Assyrian invasion, Hezekiah cried out to God for deliverance. God heard his prayers and healed Hezekiah. From Hezekiah’s faithful example, God reveals that He may heal your illness when you faithfully seek Him. <span class="underline">Second</span>, as a reward for his faith-led obedience, God extended Hezekiah’s life by 15 extra years. This confirmed promises that God made to His people through Moses. Through Hezekiah’s example, God confirmed His promise to prolong the life of a believer whose faith produces the fruit of obedience. <span class="underline">Third</span>, Hezekiah then sadly sinned by asking for a sign and by failing to thank God. God, however, was still faithful to keep His promise to Hezekiah. From this example, God reveals that He is faithful to keep His promises, even when our faith fails us. <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, Hezekiah then committed several sins when he agreed to an alliance with Babylon and showed all of Judah’s hidden gold in an act of pride. Although God could have revoked His promises to protect Judah from Assyria, He instead forgave the Jews and defeated the Assyrians. Because forgiveness is such an important part of God’s character, this theme is repeated across both chapters. Just as He did for Hezekiah, God offers to forgive His people, even when they fail to trust Him. <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, God used Isaiah to try to gently convict Hezekiah of his sins. Today, God’s Word and the Holy Spirit work together to convict sinners to cause them to repent. <span class="underline">Sixth</span>, because of Hezekiah’s sins and the sins that his son Manasseh would commit, God would discipline the Jews by sending them in to Babylonian captivity. Yet, He waited approximately a century longer to give the Jews a chance to repent. From these events, God reveals that He disciplines His people out of love to correct them. <span class="underline">Finally</span>, despite his sins, God celebrated Hezekiah for his faith and his obedience. From this example, God reveals that His mercy and grace is greater than our sins. Yet, this mercy and grace is available only through Jesus.</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">Healing: God Offers to Heal Your Illness When You Faithfully Seek Him</span>. 2 Kgs. 20:1-3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Hezekiah cries out to God when faced with a mortal illness</span>. In one of his many tests of faith, Isaiah revealed to Hezekiah that he would soon die from an illness. Hezekiah showed both his faith and his knowledge of God’s Word by praying in faith for one of the blessings that God promised for those who act with faith-led obedience. “<sup>1</sup> <em>In those days Hezekiah became mortally ill. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him and said to him, ‘Thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, ‘Set your house in order, for you shall die and not live.’’ <sup>2 </sup>Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, saying, <sup>3 </sup>‘Remember now, O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, I beseech You, how I have walked before You in truth and with a whole heart and have done what is good in Your sight.’ And Hezekiah wept bitterly</em>.” (2 Kgs. 20:1-3; 2 Chr. 32:24; Is. 38:1). These events are told out of chronological order for thematic reasons around the middle of Hezekiah’s reign. We know this because God promised to defend Jerusalem later on in this chapter: “<em>I will defend this</em> city. . .” (2 Kgs. 20:6). Based upon the length of his reign, Isaiah confronted Hezekiah with God’s testing approximately 12 years before King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded and approximately 15 years before Hezekiah died (Isa. 38:1-22). Based on the ages given in two separate verses, he was only 39 years old when Isaiah told him to prepare for his death (2 Kgs. 18:2; 20:6). This was a test of faith that God knew in advance that Hezekiah would pass. Hezekiah cried out to God and placed his trust in God to be healed. Hezekiah did not want to die. Because Manasseh was only 12 when he became king (2 Kgs. 21:1), this means that Judah would have died without an heir if God had not extended Hezekiah’s life by 15 years. God’s answer to Hezekiah’s prayers reaffirmed His conditional promise to Solomon that a faithful king would never lack an heir to the throne (1 Kgs. 9:5-9).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God can restore the health of a faithful believer</span>. Hezekiah called out in faith by reciting God’s promises. He had lived in a faith-led obedience that was unlike any king since David: “Thus Hezekiah did throughout all Judah; and he did what was good, right and true before the LORD his God.” (2 Chr. 31:20). Through Moses, God promised to pour out His blessings on those who live in faith-led obedience (Dt. 28:1-2). This can include His promise to withhold diseases and poor health: “And He said, ‘If you will give earnest heed to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight, and give ear to His commandments, and keep all His statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you which I have put on the Egyptians; for <em>I, the LORD, am your healer.</em>’” (Ex. 15:26; Dt. 7:15). ‘“See now that I, I am He, and there is no god besides Me; it is I who put to death and give life. I have wounded <em>and it is I who heal</em>, and there is no one who can deliver from My hand.”’ (Dt. 32:39). “ . . . <em>the LORD binds up the fracture of His people and heals the bruise He has inflicted</em>.” (Is. 30:26). “For He inflicts pain, and gives relief; He wounds, and <em>His hands also heal</em>.” (Job 5:8). “<em>He heals</em> the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.” (Ps. 147:3). “He sent His word <em>and healed them</em>, and delivered them from their destructions.” (Ps. 107:20). You cannot earn God’s blessings. Yet, God is faithful to bless those who live with faith-led obedience.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">All things are possible with God when you have faith</span>. Hezekiah also had faith because he knew that God can do all things: “Is anything too difficult for the LORD?” (Gen. 18:14(a)). “Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is anything too difficult for Me?” (Jer. 32:27). “I know that You can do all things, and that no purpose of Yours can be thwarted.” (Job 42:2). “‘With people this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”’ (Matt. 19:26(b); Mk. 10:27(b); Lk. 1:37). “What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who is against us?” (Ro. 8:31). God also wants you to turn to Him in faith when your health issues seem impossible. His miracles happen every day.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">You cannot earn God’s healing through your works</span>. By Jesus’ stripes you can also be healed from any infirmity: “But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the chastening for our well-being fell upon Him, <em>and by His scourging we are healed</em>.” (Is. 53:5; 1 Pet. 2:24). He is so powerful that He healed a leper merely with His touch or His command: “Jesus stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, ‘I am willing; be cleansed.’ And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.” (Matt. 8:3). Although your faith-led obedience can bring His blessing of healing, you cannot earn His healings through your works. This would undermine Jesus’ sacrifice. God illustrated this principle in the Old Testament through His healing of the Syrian leper Naaman. Naaman wanted to earn his healing through a dramatic test of his strength in the ranging mountainous rivers in Syria. He did not want to dunk himself seven times in the calm Jordan River (2 Kgs. 5:9-12). God never wants you to serve Him with the wrong motives. Yet, He also wants you to know that His offer to bless and restore your health are real. Serve Him in obedience and let Him bless you.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Cry out to God when you need deliverance from an illness or disease</span>. Some think that a true person of faith should stoically accept bad news. Yet, Hezekiah showed that he was a man faith because he cried out to God for healing. David also cried out for God when he needed healing: “O LORD my God, I cried to You for help, and <em>You healed me</em>.” (Ps. 30:2). “Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am pining away; Heal me, O LORD, for <em>my bones are dismayed</em>.” (Ps. 6:2). “As for me, I said, ‘O LORD, be gracious to me; <em>heal my soul</em>, for I have sinned against You.”’ (Ps. 41:4). Moses also cried out for God to heal his sister Miriam from her leprosy: “Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, ‘O God, heal her, I pray!”’ (Nu. 12:13). Have you cried out to God if you need healing?</p></li>

<p>2. <span class="underline">Prolonged Life: God Offers To Prolong the Life of an Obedient Believer</span>. 2 Kgs. 20:4-7.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Because of his faith-led obedience, God extends Hezekiah’s life 15 years</span>. In response to Hezekiah’s cry for healing and his faithful obedience, God extended his life by 15 years: “<sup>4 </sup><em>Before Isaiah had gone out of the middle court, the word of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> came to him, saying, <sup>5 </sup>‘Return and say to Hezekiah the leader of My people, ‘Thus says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of your father David, ‘I have heard your prayer, I have seen your tears; behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>6 </sup>I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city for My own sake and for My servant David’s sake.’’ <sup>7 </sup>Then Isaiah said, ‘Take a cake of figs.’ And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered</em>.” (2 Kgs. 20:4-7). God heard Hezekiah’s righteous prayers and gave Isaiah His response before Isaiah had even left Hezekiah’s palace. God heard his prayers and saw his tears (Isa. 38:5). God not only promised to extend his life, He also promised to defend Jerusalem from the mighty Assyrian army (2 Kgs. 20:6; Is. 37:36-37).</p>
<p><span class="underline">God promises to extend your life when you follow His Fifth Commandment</span>. As part of the Fifth Commandment, God promised to prolong the lives of believers when they follow it. When He gave this promise to Moses, the blessing was limited to a longer life for the Jews who lived inside the Promised Land: “Honor your father and your mother, <em>that your days may be prolonged</em> in the land which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God gives you.” (Ex. 20:12; Dt. 5:16). Yet, when God restated this commandment through Paul, He expended it to include a longer life and a blessed life for believers in Christ anywhere on the Earth: “Honor Your Father and Mother <em>so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth</em>.” (Eph. 6:2-3). When you follow the Fifth Commandment, God may bless you and your children through good relationships and peace: “All your sons will be taught of the LORD; and the well-being of your sons will be great.” (Is. 54:13). Through your walk with Jesus, are you giving your children a reason to honor you?</p>
<p><span class="underline">Spirit-led obedience may extend your life longer than it would have been</span>. God blessed Hezekiah because of his faith and obedience were unlike any king before him: “<sup>5 </sup>He trusted in the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, the God of Israel; so that after him there was none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor <em>among those</em> who were before him. <sup>6 </sup>For he clung to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; he did not depart from following Him, but kept His commandments, which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had commanded Moses.” (2 Kgs. 18:5). God also promises to prolong your life on Earth if you walk in faith-led obedience to God’s Commandments and His Word: “Walk in all the way that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has commanded you, so that you may live and prosper and <em>prolong your days</em> in the land that you will possess (<strong>Dt. 5:32-33;</strong> 4:40; Lev. 18:5). “Now this is the commandment, the statutes and the judgments which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God has commanded <em>me</em> to teach you, that you might do <em>them</em> in the land where you are going over to possess it, so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments which I command you, all the days of your life, and <em>that your days may be prolonged</em>.” (Dt. 6:1-2). “so that you may prolong <em>your</em> days on the land which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> swore to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey.” (Dt. 11:9). “My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep My commandments; <em>for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.”</em> (Prov. 3:1-2). “For by me your days will be multiplied, and <em>years of life will be added to you</em>.” (Prov. 9:11). “<em>The fear of the LORD prolongs life</em>, but the years of the wicked will be shortened.” (Prov. 10:27). When your faith leads to obedience, God may extend your time a day, a week, a year, a decade, or longer. You will never know how much longer He extended your life until you get to heaven. For now, He wants you to have the faith to believe that His promises are true. If you doubt His promise of a prolonged life, you should not expect Him to extend your life (Jam. 1:6-7). Indeed, “without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.” (Heb. 11:6). If you are battling a long-term illness or if you simply want to live longer, are you willing to obey in faith for God to prolong your life?</p>
<p><span class="underline">Because He loves you, God also hears your cries to Him</span>. Like Hezekiah, God also responded to the cries of His people when they were oppressed. For example, when God picked Moses in response to the cries of His people in Egypt: “The LORD said, ‘I have surely seen the affliction of My people who are in Egypt, and have given heed to their cry because of their taskmasters, for I am aware of their sufferings.’” (Ex. 3:7). He had also responded previously to their cries of oppression in the Promised Land (Jdgs. 2:18). “Many times He would deliver them; they, however, were rebellious in their counsel, and so sank down in their iniquity. Nevertheless He l</p>
