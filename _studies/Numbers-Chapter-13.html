<p>Numbers Chapter 5: Seven Rules for Keeping the Bride of Christ Pure from Sin</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><span class="underline">The Bride of Christ Must Be Free of Sin.</span> Nu. 5:1-4</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">Diseases like leprosy are caused by sin</span>. God commanded that the priests take a leper, those with “discharge” (i.e., venereal diseases), and those exposed to a rotting corpse outside of the camp where God’s people dwelt (Nu. 5:1-2). He did not want those with diseases to “defile” the camp (Nu. 5:3). Disease and sin are related. Sin caused disease to come into the world (Gen. 3:17; 9:2; Ro. 8:19-22). Leprosy is a symbol of both sin and God’s punishment of sin. For example, He infected Miriam with leprosy as a punishment for her sin when she rebelled against Moses’ leadership (Nu. 12:10). As another example, He infected King Uzziah with leprosy when he tried to take on the dual roles of King and High Priest, roles which God had separated (2 Chr. 26:19-21).</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">Leprosy and sin have to be quarantined</span>. In the ancient world, there was no cure for leprosy. Lepers had to be separated from society or the disease would spread (Lev. 13:4, 6). Before the Western world found a cure for this disease, it also placed persons infected with leprosy on islands or isolated locations where they could not inflict others. For example, the United States once turned the Hawaiian island of Molokai into a leper colony. Like leprosy, God also ordered people who intentionally sinned to be “cut off” from the community of believers because of the risked they posed to others (e.g., Ex. 30:38).</p>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">When unchecked, leprosy and sin both spread quickly</span>. Leprosy and yeast (both symbols of sin) are two of the fastest spreading microorganisms. Like leprosy, sin also spreads quickly if left unchecked: “Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.” (Jam. 1:15). “They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity, and their mind prepares deception.” (Job 15:35). “Behold, he travails with wickedness, and he conceives mischief and brings forth falsehood.” (Ps. 7:14). God provides examples of how quickly sin spreads later in the book of Numbers. For example, upon hearing the bad report from 10 spies about the “giants” in Canaan, “all” the congregation cried and wept the entire night (Nu. 14:1). The nation was so motivated by fear that they even tried to appoint a leader to bring them back their prior bondage in Egypt (Nu. 14:2-4). <em>As another example,</em> Korah’s rebellion against Moses started with a few men and then grew to include 250 “men of renown” (Nu. 16:2). It then grew to include 14,700 sympathizers, all of who God judged (Nu. 16:49). Likewise, when the Jews reached the edge of the Promised Land, a few men began to engage in the sin of temple prostitution. Their sin spread quickly within the tribes. Ultimately, God judged at least 24,000 men (Nu. 25:9). Thus, sin cannot be ignored within your body, your mind, or the Church.</p>
<p>(4) <span class="underline">Leprosy and sin cause the victim to lose feeling</span>. Leprosy kills the nerve endings in the infected skin. Appendages fall off because the victim cannot feel when he or she is causing damage to a finger or toe. Sin also causes the victim to become numb to the pain he or she is causing: “<em>being darkened in their understanding</em> . . . they, <em>having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality</em> for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.” (Eph. 4:18-19). “by means of the hypocrisy of liars <em>seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron</em>,” (1 Tim. 4:2). Feeling pain is important. For example, pain receptors keep your body from making an injury worse. Your pain receptors tell your hand to remove it from a hot stove before it gets burned. Like leprosy, unchecked sin can hinder the ability of the Holy Spirit to convict you of your sin.</p>
<p>(5) <span class="underline">Leprosy and sin both lead to death</span>. A victim of leprosy will eventually die if untreated. Like leprosy, sin also leads to death when it is not treated: “For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Ro. 6:23).</p>
<p>(6) <span class="underline">Leprosy and sin have the same cure</span>. Because leprosy is both caused by original sin and is a symbol of sin, both leprosy and sin have a common cure: “Surely our griefs He Himself bore, and our sorrows He carried; yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; the chastening for our well-being <em>fell</em> upon Him, <em>and by His scourging we are healed</em>.” (Is. 53:4-5; 1 Pet. 2:24). Jesus’ first recorded miracle was healing a leper (Matt. 8:2-3). Everything Jesus did was for a reason. This includes the order of His miracles. He was symbolically showing that He has the ability to cure the disease of sin.</p>
<p>(7) <span class="underline">Leprosy and sin both require someone to diagnose the problem</span>. With Leprosy (now called Hansen’s disease (1873)), a doctor diagnoses and treats it with antibiotics. The priests diagnosed the leprosy. Today, every believer is part of God’s holy priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). As part of God’s holy priesthood, you have a duty to direct a sinner to the cure.</p>

<p>2.) <span class="underline">Three Steps to Restoring the Bride (the Church) After She Sins</span>. Nu. 5:5-10.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">Repentance - God will forgive the repentant sinner</span>. Satan will frequently attack a repentant sinner by calling him a hypocrite and telling him that he is unfit for service. Yet, is there is no sin that is too great for God to forgive when you repent (1 Jo. 1:9). After you repent, you should not feel condemned by your prior his sins (Rom. 8:1). Your sins are no worse than the 12 men who founded the tribes of Israel. Your sins are no worse than Paul, who murdered Christians. If God was willing to accept the sacrifice of animals to atone for the sins of the Jews, you have no reason to doubt that the death of His own son would be enough to atone for your sins (Heb. 9:14). Is there any hidden sin that you are holding onto that you have not repented of?</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">Restitution - A repentant sinner must also restore his or her victims</span>. If you steal from someone and then realize your sin and repent, God still expects you to make your victim whole by returning the money (Nu. 5:7). This is called restitution. Before you come to the altar, Jesus says that you must first set things right with the person you have wronged (Matt. 5:23-24). If the sin was against God, like withholding tithes (Mal. 3:8), or if the victim was dead with no relatives, the trespass offering was in the form of a ram and 20% restitution payment to God (Nu. 5:8; Lev. 5:15-16). Ignorance of the sin or what the law required was no excuse (Lev. 5:17). If you were to think of every time you received a dollar and failed to pay a tithe, imagine how large your ledger must now be with the 20% penalty added to it?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jesus was the ram offering paid for our sins</span>. The first time a ram was offered was when Abraham was about to offer Isaac, and God instead provided a ram: “Then Abraham raised his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the place of his son.” (Gen. 22:13). The ram caught in the thicket of thorns foreshadows Jesus. He wore a crown of thorns (Jo. 19:5). He was offered as our substitute “guilt” or trespass offering against God. “But the LORD was pleased to crush Him, putting Him to grief; if He would render Himself <em>as a guilt offering</em>, He will see His offspring, He will prolong His days, and the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand. As a result of the anguish of His soul, He will see it and be satisfied; by His knowledge the Righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many, as He will bear their iniquities.” (Is. 53:10-11). Have you given thanks that Jesus has paid for your robberies against God plus interest?</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">Transformation - A repentant sinner is a new creation with a debt of gratitude</span>. There can be no forgiveness without the shedding of blood (Lev. 17:11; Heb. 9:22). In addition to being the ram of the guilt offering, Jesus was the lamb without defect who fulfilled all the sin offerings for us (Isa. 53:7; Jo. 1:29; Heb. 10:12-14; 1 Pet. 1:18-19). If you recognize that Christ paid your debt, you can show your gratitude by making yourself a “living sacrifice” to Him (Ro. 12:1). If God has transformed you, you should also not allow any provision for your old sinful self (Rom. 13:14). If you are continuing to sin, how grateful are you for what Christ did for you on the cross?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3. <span class="underline">Sanctification - Understanding the Importance of Staying Pure and Set Apart For God</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">Jesus wants to spare His bride (the Church) from the penalty of adultery</span>. The Bible prohibits adultery for both men and women (Lev. 18:20; Ex. 20:17). Jesus also reveals that the mere act of lusting after another is an act of adultery (Matt. 5:28). All are guilty of this (Ro. 3:20). For someone caught in the act of adultery, the penalty under God’s law was death by stoning (Lev. 20:10; Dt. 17:5; 22:24). Yet, Jesus did not punish the prostitute when others wanted to stone her (Jo. 8:5-7). He instead instruct her to sin no more (Jo. 8:11). Thankfully, God is slow to anger (Ex. 34:6; Nu. 14:18; Neh. 9:17; Ps. 86:15; 103:8; 145:8). When a couple is engaged in adultery, He knows it at the moment the thought first enters the sinner’s head. From Jesus’ example, the repentance of the sinner is His primary goal (Lk. 5:32; 15:7). Is there any sin in your heart that you need to repent of?</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">Jesus wants to help you to remain pure to allow you to marry Him</span>. A high priest had a tough marriage standard. He could only marry a virgin of his own people (Lev. 21:13-14). If he did not do so, he would “profane” his offspring (Lev. 21:14). Jesus is our High Priest (Heb. 8:1). We are also the adopted sons of God the Father (Ro. 8:15, 23). As High Priest, Jesus will one day marry the Church to form a bond of spiritual intimacy (Rev. 19:7-8; 21:1-9). Through His blood, you are pure to marry Him (2 Cor. 11:2; Rev. 14:4). Are you abstaining from the sinful things of this world? If not, you are committing spiritual adultery against Jesus.</p>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">Our God is jealous to protect you</span>. Adultery could only be punished with two actual witnesses, something unlikely to happen unless both confessed (Dt. 19:15; Matt. 18:16; 2 Cor. 13:1). When adultery was only suspected, a spirit of “jealousy” can overcome a suspicious spouse (Nu. 6:14). Although the text here applies this test for a man, the best Old Testament example of a person being punished by a jealous spouse was Joseph when he was falsely accused of being with Potepher’s wife (Gen. 39:20). In the New Testament, a different Joseph did not subject Mary to this test as he could have done when he discovered that she was pregnant. Instead, before an angel spoke with him, he was going to send Mary away (Matt. 1:19). God is “jealous” to protect the purity of His future bride (Dt. 4:24; 5:9; 6:15; 32:16; Jos. 24:19; Nah. 1:2). Does He have any reason to be jealous or believe that you have been spiritually unfaithful to Him?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. <span class="underline">Spiritual Adultery- Seven Tests To Stay Free From It</span>. Nu. 5:11-31.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">Openness: Are you willing to allow God to show you what is within your heart</span>? <em>The Oath to God with Loose Hair</em> (Nu. 5:18-21). A spouse could only ask that a person be tested for adultery is there was reasonable suspicion. The priest administered the test, but it was God who would show someone’s guilt or innocence. Most importantly, the participant needed to be willing to allow the test to be done. This was symbolized by the oath. The loose hair symbolized an openness where one’s defenses are let down. The woman affirmed that she had not been with another man and was under her husband’s authority (Nu. 5:19). We are under the authority of our future husband Christ. Like the priest, God tests us (Jer. 17:10; Ps. 11:5). When He tests you, He shows you where your heart is evil (Jer. 17:9). After David committed adultery and then murder to cover it up, he invited God to test him to show him where his heart remained evil (Ps. 139:23). Are you asking God show you your hidden sins? If you say to God that there is no need for Him to test you because you have no sin, God reveals that the truth is not within you (1 Jo. 1:8). Do you think God prefers the sinner who is willing to let God show him or her their sins or the self-righteous person who claims he or she has none?</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">The Holy Spirit: Are you leading a Spirit-filled life</span>? <em>The Barley Bread Without Oil</em> (Nu. 5:15). This test involved barley instead of wheat bread. No oil was used. Oil in the Bible symbolizes the Holy Spirit (1 Sam. 16:13). Barley was the wheat that came from the first of three seasonal harvests. Each of the three harvests represents a stage in a believer’s walk with God: (1) barley = justification, (2) wheat = sanctification, and (3) fruit = glorification. Barley was offered during the Feast of First Fruits (Lev. 23:9-14). This corresponded with Christ’s resurrection and symbolized the offering of a new believer (1 Cor. 15:20). Wheat, by contrast, was offered on the Festival of Weeks (Lev. 23:15-22). This was the same date as Pentecost (Acts 2:3). Thus, this corresponded with the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. When Jesus fed the masses of followers, he used “five <em>barley</em> loaves.”  (Jo. 6:9). When they were filled, He said unto His disciples, “Gather up the fragments that remain, <strong>that nothing be lost.” (Jo. 6:12). These believers, even if not strong in their walk, overcame death. But they were not yet set apart from the world. Are you living both in the world and of the world, like the masses do?</strong> Is your life filled and guided by the Holy Spirit? Is the fruit of the Holy Spirit clear for others to see around you? Or, are the decisions in your life all guided by the flesh?</p>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">Prayer: Does your prayer life leave much to be desired</span>? <em>No Frankincense</em> (Nu. 5:15). The priests used frankincense for their grain offerings (Lev. 2:2). They also to used pure frankincense for the altar of incense. Incense when burned creates smoke that was a sweet aroma to God (Lev. 24:7; Ex. 30:22-37). Because it was valuable, it was brought along with gold to Jesus by the wise men upon His birth (Mat. 2:11). The sweet aroma today that we create for God is our prayer: “And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel's hand.” (Rev. 8:4). Thus, frankincense symbolizes prayer. Are you creating a sweet aroma for God in your life?</p>
<p>(5) <span class="underline">The Word: Do you wash the sins with the world with the Word</span>? <em>A clay pot filled with holy water and the holy word</em> (Nu. 5:17). “We are the clay, and [God] [is] our potter.” (Is. 64:8). Jesus was the Word who became flesh (Jo. 1:14). The dissolved ink from the scroll symbolized His Word within us (Nu. 5:23). Water symbolized cleansing to obtain purity (Lev. 15:31). For example, the priests washed: (1) the “entrails” and the legs of a sacrifice (Lev. 1:9); (2) themselves before service (Lev. 8:6); (3) a healed leper (Lev. 14:5:8, 9); and (4) a fellow priest contaminated by death (Nu. 11:12). Jesus offered that if anyone came to Him and drank what He offered (the dissolved Word), that person would have “streams of living water flow from deep within” (Jo. 7:37-38). At His death, He poured out both blood and living water (Jo. 19:34; 1 Jo. 5:6). If we are justified by His blood, His water sanctifies us (Eph. 5:26). Thus, “[l]et us draw near . . . having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and <em>our bodies washed with pure water</em>.” (Heb. 10:22). The pure water to wash our bodies comes from confession of sin (1 Jo. 1:9). Indeed, when John the Baptist preached, he stated that baptism was for repentance (Matt. 3:11; Mk. 1:4; Acts 19:4). Today, you wash by reading the Word: “so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,” (Eph. 5:26). Are you reading the Word to clean yourself of the filth of this world? If so, are you bathing daily, weekly, or even less frequently?</p>
<p>(6) <span class="underline">The Flesh: Are you drawn to the things of the world instead of the things of God</span>? <em>Earth dust in the clay pot, causing a swelling abdomen and wasting thighs</em> (Nu. 5:17-22). As stated above, we are the clay pots that God made (Is. 64:8). The dust added to the water symbolized the things of this world. It was also a symbol of death (Ps. 23:15). The stomach is where your food goes. It symbolizes what you crave. The thigh of the animal symbolized its strength in the context of a fellowship offering. By eating this portions of the animal in fellowship with God, the priest was acknowledging that his strength comes from God, and he was giving his strength to God (Lev. 7:31-34; 8:26; 9:21). When you accept Christ, your old desires of the flesh should fade away: “knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin;” (Ro. 6:6; Eph. 4:22; Col. 3:9). When you are tested by the things of the world around you, do you crave them, like the women with the swelling abdomen? (1 Jo. 2:15-17). If so, you have become fallen into spiritual adultery.</p>
<p>(7) <span class="underline">Your Fruit: Are you bearing fruit for God or are you a curse to His people</span>? (Nu. 5:27-28). Jesus said that you would know someone by their fruits: “You will know them by their fruits. Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?” (Matt. 7:16, 20). Here, someone who passed the test bears fruit by bearing offspring. If this story speaks to you in your spiritual relationship with God, the offspring must be spiritual as well. Are you bearing offspring in the Lord? Have you lead someone to the holy water of Christ? Alternatively, are your fruits a curse to God’s people? If your fruits are only for your enjoyment, do you think they are much use to God?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the Spirit through the bond of peace.” (Eph. 4:2-6).</p>
<p><span class="underline">To cook with the Holy Spirit, set your mind daily on the Spirit</span>. How do we cook with the Holy Spirit? “For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.” (Rom. 8:5). Because we gravitate to the flesh every day, we must renew our minds “daily” (Rom. 12:2.)</p>
<p><span class="underline">To make sure that you are cooking with the Spirit, check your fruits</span>. How do we know if we are cooking with the Spirit? You check your fruits (Matt. 7:16). “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.” (Gal. 5:22-23). “Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.” (Gal. 5:19-21). Which set of fruits applies to you? Is there any area in your life were the deeds of the flesh are present?</p>
<p>2. <span class="underline">Cooking Tip no. 2: Only use a sinless life</span>. (Unleavened Bread).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Our life offering to God must be free from sin</span>. The grain offering was to be made from “unleavened bread.” (Lev. 2:4, 11; Ex. 12:15; 29:1-3; Nu. 6:15). Leaven is a symbol of sin (1 Cor. 5:6-8; Gal. 5:9). The Jews were first told not to use leaven to bake their bread (which takes time to cook) because they needed to immediately flee from the land of bondage to the Promised Land (Ex. 12:8, 15). The rabbis taught that if a Jew had to wait for the bread to rise before they could join God’s people they were still in emotional bondage of Egypt. Today, we are the bride of Christ (Rev. 22:2, 17). The house or temple where the Holy Spirit dwells is in our bodies (1 Cor. 3:16-17). Because the Holy Spirit dwells within us, we must remove the leaven from our bodies (1 Cor. 5:7; 6:13-15; 18-20).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">If we ignore sin, it will rise</span>. Leaven is the baking ingredient that causes bread to rise. One gram of yeast contains 20,000,000,000 (twenty billion) single-celled living micro-organisms. If we leave any hidden sin in our lives, it will rise like leaven in bread. Is there any small sin in your life that you have failed to remove? If so, it will not stay hidden for long.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Yeast comes in many forms</span>. Over 600 different species of yeast are known and they are widely distributed in nature. Should you be looking for only one kind of hidden sin in your life? Or, should you be looking for many kinds of sin?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">We must find our hidden sins through the Word</span>. Jesus once referred to believers as being “mixed with leaven” (Matt. 13:33). If we wish to remove the leaven in our lives, we must first find it through reading the Word. “[T]hrough the law comes the knowledge of sin.” (Rom. 3:20). Once we find our sins, we must repent of them. Are you reading the Word daily to find your sins?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">To keep our bodies free of sin, we must keep our eyes and minds clean</span>. Jesus warns that: “[t]he eye is the lamp of the body; so then if your eye is clear, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light that is in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!” (Matt. 6:22-23). Are you protecting your eyes from sinful things? If not, you are filling your mind and body with darkness.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3. <span class="underline">Cooking Tip no. 3: Your Will Must Be Crushed</span>. (the fine flour).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Our life offering must serve God, not ourselves</span>. The priest was told to use only “fine flour.” (Lev. 2:1, 7; Nu. 7:13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73, 79). To become fine, however, the flour must be “crushed.” Fine flour has to be continually crushed to be refined. We are crushed and purified so that we will seek to fulfill God’s will in our lives, not our own: “For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.” (Jo. 6:34). Our will also must be subject to the Father’s will or the Holy Spirit cannot fully come upon us (2 Cor. 4:8). Are you serving God’s will or your own?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Offer the best of your life</span>. The fine flour also meant that the offering for God involved only the best ingredients. Are you giving God the best of your time, talent, and treasure?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God does not want you to delay your life offering</span>. “Another of the disciples said to Him, ‘Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.’ But Jesus said to him, ‘Follow Me, and allow the dead to bury their own dead.’” (Matt. 8:21-23). We cannot wait to get our personal affairs in order before we go and serve the Lord. Are you being disobedient to a calling in your life by waiting until a time you think is convenient?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The Holy Spirit will purge you of sin through trial and tribulation</span>. In order to crush you of your own will, God must also purify you by fire. The bread of the life offering was baked over a fire. In at least one of the Jewish festivals called <em>Rosh Hashanah</em>, the bread offering was also thrown into God’s fire (Lev. 23:24-25). The fire symbolized the purification and judgment of the Spirit. God is a consuming fire (Dt. 4:24; Josh. 6:24; 1 Sam. 3-23; 1 Kgs. 18:18-40). He “shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.” (Mal. 3:3). It is the job of the Holy Spirit to purge sin and self will from us through fire and tribulation (1 Cor. 3:13-15; 1 Pet. 1:7). Heat above a certain limit will also kill the yeast in your life. With yeast, each yeast cell, on average, undergoes this budding process 12 to 15 times before it is no longer capable of reproducing. Yet, if yeast becomes too hot or sits too long it will in essence rot and be of no value to a baker trying to make the bread rise. Thus, to remove our yeast, the fire of the Holy Spirit is a vital part of our renewal: “Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these things, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.” (2 Tim. 2:21). If God has allowed trials in your life, rejoice because this may be the Holy Spirit cleansing you of your will and preparing you for service (1 Pet. 4:13). Is your life offering still filled with selfish desires? If so, the Holy Spirit still has work to do.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <span class="underline">Cooking Tip no. 4: Your Life Offering Must Include Regular Prayer</span>. (the Frankincense).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Your Life Must Be Filled with Righteous Prayer</span>. God also told the priest to cook with frankincense (Lev. 2:2). This was the chief ingredient used to make incense in the Tabernacle (Ex. 30:34-35). Because it was considered so valuable, it was brought along with gold to Jesus by the wise men upon His birth. Incense when burned creates smoke. Here, it is used to create a sweat aroma to God. Today, we can create a “soothing aroma” for God through our prayers: “<em>May my prayer be counted as incense before You . . .</em> ” (Ps. 141:2; Rev. 5:8; 8:3). The Holy Spirit then communicates God’s answers to our prayers (Jo. 14:16-18; 14:25-26).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Pray at least two times a day</span>. The priests created a soothing aroma on two separate occasions each day, in the morning and at twilight (Lev. 6:20; Ex. 30:7-8; Nu. 28:4, 8). The psalmist David states that he prayed in the morning (Ps. 5:3; 88:13). He also prayed at twilight (Ps. 63:6; 141:2). The twilight offering happened in the mid afternoon at the ninth hour. Peter and John, for example went “to the temple at the ninth hour, <em>the hour of prayer</em>.” (Acts 3:1). Christ was crucified at the appointed time of the morning sacrifice and died at the appointed time of the mid-afternoon sacrifice (Mk. 15:25, 34). This suggests that God wants us to create a soothing prayer aroma to Him twice a day to honor Christ (1 Chron. 23:30; 1 Thess. 5:17; Rom. 12:12; Col. 4:2; Jam. 5:16). Are you praying at least twice a day?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Make your prayers righteous before God</span>. The incense was to have equal amounts of “stacte and onycha, galbanum and pure frankincense.” (Ex. 30:34). The incense was to be “salted, pure and holy.” (Ex. 30:35). The incense was also to be fragrant or sweet (Ex. 30:7). Moreover, the priest was warned not to burn any “strange incense.” (Ex. 30:9). Aaron’s sons Nabad and Abihu later died for burning “strange fire” that God had not commanded (Lev. 10:1-3). This means that some prayers are not pleasing to God. In the Old Testament, God warned that He would not hear the prayers of those in open rebellion “If I regard wickedness in my heart, The Lord will not hear;” (Ps. 66:18; Is. 1:15-16). In the New Testament, God warns that sin can “hinder” your prayers (1 Pet. 3:7; Jo. 9:31). Is there sin in your life that might be “hindering” your prayers?</p></li>

<p>5. <span class="underline">Cooking Tip no. 5: Your Life Offering Should Convict Others</span>. (the salt).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Your life must stand out for God’s will in a corrupt world</span>. God also told the priest to offer salt with the grain offering (Lev. 2:13). Salt also was part of any burnt offering (Ezek. 43:24). Salt gives the food taste. It creates thirst. It is also a symbol of judgment. For example, Lot’s wife was turned into salt (Gen. 19:26). On other occasions, salt was scattered on destroyed cities to destroy crops (Dt. 29:23; Jdgs. 9:45; Ps. 137:34; Jer. 17:5-6; 48:9; Zeph. 2:9). Salt also had a second meaning. We are called to be “salt” and light (Matt. 5:13). Salt irritates an open wound. Do you cause others to apologize for profanity or their speech when they are around you? Do you cause others to thirst for the living water of truth from your salt? Or, do you blend in around any setting?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Your convictions must not bend to the world</span>. God later referred to a “covenant of salt.” (Nu. 18:19). Salt was part of a covenant because it had a lasting quality (Gen. 31:54; Ex. 24:5-11; Ps. 50:5). It also foreshadowed Christ’s everlasting covenant with us (Gen. 17:7; Ps. 105:10). Salt was used to keep meat from turning rotten. We must be like salt in a rotting world. This includes being steadfast in your faith. Do you let things around you change the way you think about God? Or, do you remain steadfast in following His Word?</p></li>

<p>6. <span class="underline">Cooking Tip no. 6: A life of denial brings joy</span>. (the honey).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Store up your pleasures in heaven</span>. The priests were also told not to put honey in their offerings on the altar (Lev. 2:11). The Promised Land was also called the land of milk and honey. There are great treasures that await us in our Promised Land called heaven. Yet, Jesus tells us to sacrifice our pleasures today - “the honey” - so that we may store up these treasures in heaven. “But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in or steal.” (Matt. 6:20). He also tells us to deny ourselves. “Then Jesus said to His disciples, ‘If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me.”’ (Matt. 16:24). Are giving up things for God? Or, do you live a life of gluttony?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Self-denial allows God to fill you with joy</span>. Although God would not allow honey to be sacrificed, it could become part of a person’s first fruit offering. When you deny yourself, you allow God to fill you with the joy of the Spirit. Frequently, self-indulgence and greed brings misery as the person craves that which the person does not have. Those who consciously decide not to indulge the flesh find the joy of the Spirit. This can include fasting or other forms of self-denial. This is the honey of the first fruits offering. Through self-denial, your life offering will become filled by the Spirit with joy for others. “But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and share my joy with you all.” (Phil. 2:17). “Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I do my share on behalf of His body, which is the church, in filling up what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions.” (Col. 1:24). The joy of the Spirit should be light for others: “You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden; nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on the lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.” (Matt. 5:14-15). Do you ever fast or deny yourself the things of the flesh? If you see no value in fasting, ask if your life filled with joy for others to see.</p></li>

<p>7. <span class="underline">Cooking Tip no. 7: Be Generous with Your Life Offering</span>. (The priest’s share).</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Your life should include sharing with others</span>. The priests who performed the sacrifices were also to receive a portion of the grain offering (Lev. 2:10). God also required that the priests give a “tithe of a tithe.” (Nu. 18:24-29). The priest’s tithes and the people’s tithes benefited those who were in need. The priests directed the tithes to those who needed the help the most. They gave to one another like the believers did in the book of Acts. “They were continually devoting themselves to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. . . And all those who had believed were together and had all things in common; and they began selling their property and possessions and were sharing them with all, as anyone might have need. Day by day continuing with one mind in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were taking their meals together with gladness and sincerity of heart.” (Acts 2:42-47). Are you sharing with those in need?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Be a generous giver</span>. We are not just commanded to give, we are commanded to be generous givers (Ex. 36:2-7; 2 Cor. 9:6; 8-14). If you hold back your tithes, you sin against God. Yet, if you give to Him and trust Him, does He promise to give back to you greatly: ‘“Will a man rob God? Yet you are robbing Me! But you say, ‘How have we robbed You?’ In tithes and offerings. You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing Me, the whole nation <em>of you</em>! Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, so that there may be food in My house, and test Me now in this,’ says the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> of hosts, ‘if I will not open for you the windows of heaven and pour out for you a blessing until it overflows.’” (Mal. 3:8-10). Are you withholding a tenth of your wages out of joy and not obligation? Will you trust God and give with joy when times are bad?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Give with the right motives</span>. God will not bless you with material prosperity if that will only feed greed and covetousness in your life. If your heart is not right, your tithes are not acceptable to God. “Bring your worthless offerings no longer, incense is an abomination to Me. New moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies -- I cannot endure iniquity and the solemn assembly.” (Isa. 1:13; Jer. 7:21-24). Likewise, you should never give publically for others to see your public generosity. God says that those people have already received their rewards. Those who give in secret will be rewarded in heaven. “But when you give to the poor, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving will be in secret; and your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.” (Matt. 6:3-4). Finally, we are to be cheerful givers: “Now this I say, he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each one must do just as he has purposed in his heart, not grudgingly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.” (2 Cor. 9:6-7). Are you giving cheerfully on a regular basis with the right motives? Are you telling others how much you give because you enjoy the reputation of being a philanthropist? If so, you are leaving nothing for God to reward you with.</p></li>
