<p>Genesis 49: Seven Lessons From Israel’s Final Blessings and Warnings to the 12 Tribes</p>
<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span>: Believers can learn a lot from the final words of the great leaders in the Bible. With Noah’s final recorded words, he blessed and gave prophetic words for his children (Gen. 9:24-27). During what Isaac mistakenly thought were his final days, he sought to bless his eldest son Esau. Yet, he was tricked into giving that blessing to Jacob (Gen. 27:34-41). At the end of his life, Jacob/ Israel blessed the children of Joseph and adopted them as his own (Gen. 48:13-22). In the final moments of his life, he then blessed and gave prophetic words to each of his 12 sons (Gen. 49:1-27). At the end of Moses’ life, he also blessed and gave prophetic words to each of the 12 tribes (Dt. 33:1-29). Jesus’ final words on the cross included the blessing of forgiveness for those who persecuted Him (Lk. 23:34). After His resurrection, His final words included a blessing that He would never leave or forsake His people: “I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” (Matt. 28:20). This study traces the prophetic blessings through Israel and then through Moses. While some tribes seized their prophetic blessings, others did not. Any believer in Christ is an heir to the blessings offered to Abraham’s descendants (Gal. 3:29). Thus, these lessons from the 12 tribes apply to you. From the different examples of the 12 tribes, God reveals seven lessons for believers to both seize His blessings and to bless others.</p>
<p><span class="underline">First</span>, Israel gathered his 12 sons and commanded them to listen as he prophesized over them. From this, God reveals that He will also bless you when you return to Him and listen in faith to His Word. Your faith comes from hearing the Word (Ro. 10:17). <span class="underline">Second</span>, Israel began by recounting the blessings of the four sons of Leah. Each committed terrible sins. Each was blessed with God’s mercy and grace. Yet, those with the greatest blessings amongst these four (Levi and Judah) repented of their sins and served God. Like the first four tribal fathers, you also have been blessed with God’s mercy and grace. Like Levi and Judah, you too can enjoy the blessings that come from repenting of your sins and serving God. <span class="underline">Third</span>, Israel next blessed out of their correct order the final two sons of Leah, Zebulun and Issachar. These two sons would always be listed and blessed together. From this, God reveals that He will bless you when you act in unity of the Spirit with the greater body of Christ. <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, Israel next blessed the four sons of his concubines. Each was a child born of the flesh. Each would be considered an illegitimate child today. Each was blessed to be an adopted tribe of God. Yet, each failed to live up to the full potential of their blessings. You as well are blessed to be an adopted child of God. You as well are called upon to live up to the full potential of the blessings offered to you. <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, Israel then blessed the children of Rachel (Joseph and Benjamin). Each was blessed for their faithfulness. Yet, the tribes that succeeded them did not follow in their fathers’ examples. As a result, they lost the blessings granted by their founding fathers. You as well will be blessed for your faithfulness. You as well are warned that if you turn away from God there are certain blessings (unrelated to your salvation) that may temporarily be unavailable to you. <span class="underline">Sixth</span>, Israel blessed each son according to his works. You are not saved based upon your works. Yet, Christ promised to bless you according to your faith-driven works for Him that are done with the right motives. <span class="underline">Finally</span>, in his last words, Israel asked to be buried in the Promised Land. Like Israel, your hope should be in the blessing of the eternal Promised Land, not in the things of this world.</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">God Will Bless You When You Return to Him and Listen to His Word</span>. Gen. 49:1-3.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Israel summons his 12 sons to bless and prophesize over them</span>. After blessing and adopting Joseph’s two sons, Israel gathered his 12 sons to his death bed. He then commanded them to “listen” as he prophesized over them: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Then Jacob summoned his sons and said, ‘Assemble yourselves that I may tell you what will befall you in the days to come. <sup>2 </sup>‘Gather together and hear, O sons of Jacob; and listen to Israel your father</em>.’” (Gen. 49:1-2). Israel’s reference to the “days to come” is similar to the prophets’ end-times reference to either the “last days” or the “latter days” (e.g., Is. 2:2; Dan. 10:14; Hos. 3:5). According to one Messianic Jewish organization, Israel’s words were not meant to be fulfilled during the remaining lives of his children. Instead, they referenced the end times: “The Hebrew behind the phrase ‘days to come’ (<em>acharit hayamin</em>) also translates as ‘last days.’ Jacob’s prophecies stretched all the way through the history of Israel and into the last days.” (First Fruits of Zion, Torah Club, Vol. 2, Shadows of the Messiah, <em>Vayechi</em>, (2016) p. 230).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Listen to God’s prophetic Word through His prophets and Christ</span>. Like Israel, Moses promised that God’s people would return and understand His voice: “When you are in distress and all these things have come upon you, <em>in the latter days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice</em>.” (Dt. 4:30). Jeremiah also promised that God’s prophetic Word would be clearly understood in the last days: “The anger of the LORD will not turn back until He has performed and carried out the purposes of His heart; <em>in the last days you will clearly understand it</em>.” (Jer. 23:20). In the Old Testament, God spoke through prophets and even non-believers (cf., Nu. 24:14; Dan. 2:28). In the New Testament, He spoke through Christ and His disciples: “<em>in these last days has spoken to us in His Son</em>, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He made the world.” (Heb. 1:2). Through Jesus, God has made His promises clear. You only need to listen and believe in faith. Listening to His word will build up your faith: “So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.” (Ro. 10:17). When you hear the Word and believe in faith, you become an heir to the blessings and warnings given to the 12 tribes. Like all believers, God blessed the tribes with His mercy and grace. They were also blessed to be adopted into His family. He also blessed some for their faithfulness. Yet, the greatest blessings came to those tribes which humbly recognized their sins and repented.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <span class="underline">The First Four Sons of Leah: Christ’s Blessings of Mercy and Grace</span>. Gen. 49:3-12.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Overview</span>: Israel’s blessings began with his blessings of his first four sons through Leah. These first four sons are listed separately from the other sons in Genesis 29 because they reflected God’s mercy and grace upon Jacob’s unloved wife Leah. The next seven sons, whose births are recorded in Genesis 30, reflected the jealous competition between Leah and Rachel. The first four sons committed terrible sins. Yet, each received God’s mercy and grace. Yet, like many believers, each tribe would treat His mercy and grace differently. Some used His mercy and grace as a license to sin further. The tribes which responded to His mercy and grace by repenting and drawing closer to Him received the greatest blessings.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Reuben</span>. Israel began his blessings for the tribes with the first-born tribe of Reuben. Yet, he rebuked Reuben for sleeping with his concubine Bilhah: “<sup>3 </sup><em>‘Reuben, you are my firstborn; my might and the beginning of my strength, preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power. <sup>4 </sup>‘Uncontrolled as water, you shall not have preeminence, because you went up to your father’s bed; then you defiled it—he went up to my couch</em>.” (Gen. 49:3-4). Reuben was the son of Leah, Jacob’s unloved wife (Gen. 29:30-32). Normally, Reuben would be entitled to a double blessing as the firstborn (Dt. 21:15-17). Yet, out of a lust for power, he slept with Bilhah, Rachel’s maid servant (Gen. 35:22). Reuben, like Satan, was not content with his exalted position and wanted more power and pre-eminence (Is. 14:12; Ez. 28:12). Jesus warns that many who desire to be first or pre-eminent in power will become last in importance (Mk.10:31). Because God considered Bilhah to be a wife of Jacob, Reuben’s actions violated His Law: ‘“You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife; it is your father’s nakedness.”’ (Lev. 18:8; Dt. 22:30; 1 Cor. 5:1). He was therefore cursed: ‘“Cursed is he who lies with his father’s wife, because he has uncovered his father’s skirt.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.”’ (Dt. 27:20; Lev. 20:11). As part of his curse, he lost his firstborn status (1 Chr. 5:1-2). While in the wilderness, his tribe failed to learn from Israel’s rebuke. Leaders from the tribe of Rueben later joined in Korah’s rebellion against Moses, possibly to regain their pre-eminent role (Nu. 16:1). Reuben was said to be like “uncontrolled water”. (Gen. 49:4). Like uncontrolled water, his tribe declined as it gave into various sins in the wilderness. While in the wilderness, the tribe decreased in size for its rebellion from 46,500 to 43,730 fighting men (Nu. 1:22; 26:7). Those who are like unstable water in their faith are warned that they should expect nothing from God (Jam. 1:6-8). Yet, out of mercy and grace, Moses blessed it so that it might live and grown in number: “<sup>6 </sup>May Reuben live and not die, nor his men be few.” (Dt. 33:6). Reuben’s tribe, however, settled in modern day Jordan. His tribe did not want what God offered in the Promised Land. The outside world looked better to it. Just as Israel warned, it never excelled by offering any leaders or judges for Israel. As Jesus warned, some who are first and misuse their privilege will become last in the Kingdom (Matt. 19:30). After the later exile of the Jews in Babylon, it had no land to return to. It became one of the lost tribes of Israel. The message in Moses’ blessing for believers is that God is a God of grace. He does not want any to perish (2 Pet. 3:9). Like Reuben, you are a sinner. Like Reuben, God will rebuke sinners. Yet, also like Reuben, He wants you to live. The choice of every person is to accept the free gift of forgiveness that Christ offers (Jo. 3:16). Have you thanked Him for His mercy and grace?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Simeon and Levi</span>. After rebuking Reuben, Israel rebuked his sons Simeon and Levi: “<sup>5 </sup>‘<em>Simeon and Levi are brothers; their swords are implements of violence. <sup>6 </sup>‘Let my soul not enter into their council; let not my glory be united with their assembly; because in their anger they slew men, and in their self-will they lamed oxen. <sup>7 </sup>‘Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel. I will disperse them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel</em>.” (Gen. 49:5-7). Simeon and Levi were the third and fourth sons of Leah and Jacob (Gen. 29:33-34). After their sister Dinah was raped, Simeon and Levi plotted for revenge against the people of Shechem. Hamor, the father of the rapist, sought to make restitution for his son’s crime (Gen. 34:8-12). Simeon and Levi then tricked the people of Shechem to be circumcised to become part of God’s people. While the people recovered from their pain, the two killed the people in cold blood and looted their flocks and their women and children (Gen. 34:25-26). Thus, the alliance of Simeon and Levi was an unholy one. When God’s people formed an unholy alliance at Babel, He “scattered” them across the Earth (Gen. 11:8-11). God disciplined the descendants of Simeon and Levi by “scattering” them throughout the Promised Land (Gen. 49:7). Yet, each future tribe would respond to this discipline differently. In the case of Levi, the tribe turned God’s discipline into a good for all of greater Israel (Ro. 8:28). The Levites would receive no land (Nu. 26:62). Instead, they repented of their sins and were then set apart as priests for God’s use (Nu. 18:10-11; Lev. 6:16-18; 7:6; Dt. 18:1; 14:27-29). They were given as servants for God as a substitute for the firstborn from every family (Nu. 8:16-17; 3:41). If they had not done this, the firstborn of each family would have been given to the Lord (Ex. 13:1-16). While in the wilderness, the tribe grew for being loyal to God from 22,000 to 23,000 men (Nu. 4:39; 26:62). Their growth shows that believers can achieve spiritual growth when they are set apart for God. Like the Levities, you are counted as part of God’s “holy priesthood”. (1 Peter 2:5, 9). Moses later blessed Levi for doing God’s work in guiding people through the Spirit (symbolized by the stones Thummim and Urim) and for teaching the people God’s Law: “<sup>8 </sup>Of Levi he said, “<em>Let</em> Your Thummim and Your Urim <em>belong</em> to Your godly man, whom You proved at Massah, with whom You contended at the waters of Meribah; <sup>9 </sup>Who said of his father and his mother, ‘I did not consider them’; and he did not acknowledge his brothers, nor did he regard his own sons, for they observed Your word, and kept Your covenant. <sup>10 </sup>They shall teach Your ordinances to Jacob, and Your law to Israel. They shall put incense before You, and whole burnt offerings on Your altar. <sup>11 </sup>“O <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, bless his substance, and accept the work of his hands; shatter the loins of those who rise up against him, and those who hate him, so that they will not rise <em>again</em>.” (Dt. 33:8-11). By being scattered throughout the Promised Land, they blessed the people everywhere by being a light to them (Is. 49:6). By contrast, the Simeon tribe never repented. Zimri was a leader from the tribe of Simeon. He openly brought a temple harlot home for all to see after God began to punish the nation of Israel for its temple prostitution (Nu. 25:6, 14). Of the 24,000 people who died in God’s punishment (Nu. 25:9), most were believed to be from this tribe. While in the wilderness, Simeon went from 59,300 to 22,200 fighting men (Nu. 1:23; 26:14). This was a decrease of 37,100 or <em>62.56</em>%. In absolute terms, Simeon went from being the third largest tribe to the smallest. When Moses blessed the 12 tribes at the end of his life, he had nothing to say about Simeon! (Dt. 33). The Simeon tribe continued to diminish in strength after entering Israel, just as God foretold. After the Jews defeated the Canaanites, they were then interspersed with the tribe of Judah (Josh. 19:9). The tribe was eventually absorbed by the tribe of Judah. They no longer know their true Master, and they lost their identity (Is. 1:3). Like Simeon and Levi, all have been judged because of their sins. Yet, you are called upon to follow Levi’s example. This includes repenting of your sins and serving God by being a light to others (Matt. 5:14). If God has disciplined you out of love, have you repented and used His mercy and grace to serve Him out of gratitude?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Judah</span>. Israel then prahat lands lost through debts or misfortune be restored to them: “<sup>13 </sup>‘<em>On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property. <sup>14 </sup>If you make a sale, moreover, to your friend or buy from your friend’s hand, you shall not wrong one another. <sup>15 </sup>Corresponding to the number of years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your friend; he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops. <sup>16 </sup>In proportion to the extent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to the fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is a number of crops he is selling to you. <sup>17 </sup>So you shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God; for I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God</em>.” (Lev. 25:13-17). By contrast, the Sabbath year did not offer the restoration of lost property. This rule was unique to the Jubilee year.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God also promises to restore you</span>. God can also restore your lost property to you. He can bless whomever He chooses. He also promises to restore you in many other ways. For those who accept Jesus Christ, He promises restoration in the form of resurrection from the dead (Jo. 3:16; 5:24). After you repent, you can have your spirit restored by having your sins blotted out (Acts 3:19-21; Ps. 51:7). “All” of your prior sins will be forgotten (Heb. 8:12). God can also restore your joy and peace (Ps. 51:12; Ro. 15:13). He can also heal the broken hearted (Lk. 4:18). He further can give rest to the weary (Matt. 11:28). He can restore your health (Jer. 30:17; Ps. 103:3; 107:20; Is. 30:26; 33:24; Ex. 15:26). For some, He also promises to restore lands eaten by insects or destroyed by natural disasters (Joel 2:25-26). No matter what kind of damage sin may have done to you, you can be restored “through Christ who strengthens” you (Phil. 4:13). If you are in need of restoration, are you praying in faith to God for Him to restore you?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s promise to restore the land during the Millennial Reign</span>. God told the people to “sow your field,” prune your vineyard,” and “gather in its crop” (Lev. 25:3). Toiling the ground, however, was part of the curse that Adam and Eve brought on us (Gen. 3:17; Rom. 5:12-17). After their sin, Satan became the ruler of the Earth, and we were all sold into the bondage of sin (Rom. 7:14). Yet, Satan could not take permanent title because God reveals that the “land is mine.” “<sup>23 </sup>‘<em>The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine; for you are but aliens and sojourners with Me. <sup>24 </sup>Thus for every piece of your property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land</em>.” (Lev. 25:23-24). At the time of the Second Coming, the land will revert back to God (Lev. 25:28). During the Millennial Reign, Jesus will also rule as Messiah over the restored land, and He will lift the curse on the land (Rom. 5:12-17). Believers will no longer need to “reap” or “sow” to eat (Lev. 25:4-5). Believers will be able to glean from the fields anything they need (Lev. 19:9-10; 23:22). The entire natural world will also be transformed. All forms of animal predation will end. And all conflict will end (Isa. 65:25). Thus, believers will never need to worry about feeling unsafe in the wild. God will also provide the housing for every believer. The Levites (God’s priests) had a “permanent right of redemption for their houses” (Lev. 25:32). Because believers are God’s priests (1 Peter 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6), Jesus promises each believer a home to live in (Jo. 14:2). God will also provide brilliant clothes for His believers (Rev. 3:5; 18). Believers will also receive new bodies that will not decay during the 1,000-year reign (Phil. 3:20-21; Rom. 8:28-30; 6:5-8; 1 Cor. 15:49; 2 Cor. 3:17-18). Are you sharing the good news of the hope of the world to come with others? (Matt. 28:16-20).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">We have a mere lease on life</span>. Today, when an owner has an unencumbered ownership in a property, he or she has what the law calls a “fee simple” interest. This type of land ownership can be freely sold, transferred, and passed down between generations. By contrast, when a person merely uses a land for a period of time, he or she is said to be “leaseholder” or a “tenant.” Because God owns the land (Lev. 25:23-24), people living in the Millennial Reign or in the New Jerusalem in Heaven will live as tenants on God’s land. Much like the land laws of the future, we have a mere lease on life. In His sovereignty, it is His prerogative to decide how long each person lives. Are you using your limited time to serve the King of Kings or yourself?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>4. <span class="underline">The Promise of Quicker Restoration through a Kinsman Redeemer</span>. Lev. 25:25-34.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The law of the kinsman redeemer</span>. God did not force people to wait until either the Sabbath or the Jubilee year to be restored. Because He does not want His people in bondage, He provided a law to allow people to be redeemed immediately if a family member had the means to pay for a person’s debts. If a family had the means to do so, God required a “kinsman” to purchase either a family member sold as a servant or land lost by a family member. Only if a kinsman redeemer could not be found would the person who lost their freedom or their property need to wait until the Sabbath or Jubilee year to be redeemed: “<sup>25 </sup>‘<em>If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of his property, then his nearest kinsman is to come and buy back what his relative has sold. <sup>26 </sup>Or in case a man has no kinsman, but so recovers his means as to find sufficient for its redemption, <sup>27 </sup>then he shall calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and so return to his property. <sup>28 </sup>But if he has not found sufficient means to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it shall revert, that he may return to his property</em>.” (Lev. 25:25-28). A brother or cousin kinsman redeemer could also to marry a cousin or brother’s widow to support the family and keep the land within the family (Dt. 25:5-10). This is what Boaz did for Naomi and Ruth (Ruth 4:9-10). In that time, no social security system existed. Thus, God’s laws were meant to protect the people from bondage and free them as soon as possible.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s distinction between urban and rural agricultural land</span>. God’s redemption rules for the land were meant primarily to protect agricultural lands past down from generation to generation and lands held by His priests, who had restrictions on what they could own. If the land lost was urban land within a walled city, the person or family who lost their house had only one year to redeem it: “<sup>29 </sup>‘<em>Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right of redemption lasts a full year. <sup>30 </sup>But if it is not bought back for him within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not revert in the jubilee. <sup>31 </sup>The houses of the villages, however, which have no surrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption rights and revert in the jubilee. <sup>32 </sup>As for cities of the Levites, the Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities which are their possession. <sup>33 </sup>What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may be redeemed and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel. <sup>34 </sup>But pasture fields of their cities shall not be sold, for that is their perpetual possession</em>.” (Lev. 25:29-34). These laws protected family farms while allowing for near unfettered capitalism in the urban context.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>5. <span class="underline">God’s Protection for the Poor From Economic Bondage From Debt</span>. Lev. 25:35-43.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s law limiting when interest can be charged</span>. God not only wanted to free people from indentured servitude or bondage, He also tried to keep people from being placed into economic bondage. To do this, He limited who could be charged interest. His law allowed for commercial lending. He just prohibited “usurious interest” for those who were not poor. He also prohibited interest of any kind being placed on the poor: <strong>“</strong><sup>35 </sup>‘<em>Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner, that he may live with you. <sup>36 </sup>Do not take usurious interest from him, but revere your God, that your countryman may live with you. <sup>37 </sup>You shall not give him your silver at interest, nor your food for gain. <sup>38 </sup>I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God. <sup>39 </sup>‘If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave’s service. <sup>40 </sup>He shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee. <sup>41 </sup>He shall then go out from you, he and his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to the property of his forefathers. <sup>42 </sup>For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. <sup>43 </sup>You shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God</em>.” (Lev. 25:35-43). Placing yourself into a loan that you cannot afford is frequently the path to misery, depression, distress, and economic bondage.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s laws prohibiting interest-bearing loans to the poor</span>. In Exodus, God first stated His rule prohibiting the Jews from charging interest on any loan to the poor: “If you lend money to My people, to the poor among you, you are not to act as a creditor to him; you shall not charge him interest.” (Ex. 22:25). Yet, when Moses repeated this rule in Deuteronomy, he did not repeat that these rules were to protect the poor: “You shall not charge interest to your countrymen: interest on money, food, or anything that may be loaned at interest.” (Dt. 23:19). Lending to a foreigner with interest was, however, allowed: “You may charge interest to a foreigner . . .” (Dt. 23:20). Orthodox Jews later followed the more broadly worded rules to prohibit Jews from charging interest on any loan to another Jew. Yet, many Jews later realized that this rule was unworkable in a commercial society. Thus, they came up with ways to get around their own rules. After Jesus died, some rabbis created a legal loophole in Jewish law (called a “<em>Prozbul</em>”) to get around both their prohibition on interest and the cancelation of debts on the Jubilee year. It was a legal document that accompanied any loan. It transferred title to the loan to a court entity, which the rabbis then labeled as exempt from God’s rules. For businesses or the wealthy, it also created a partnership for loans to be paid back with profits, not interest. Yet, these legal loopholes were unnecessary. God’s rules were designed to protect the poor, not commercial enterprises and the wealthy. He made this clear through later warnings in the Bible against charging exorbitant interest that might place people into economic bondage (Prov. 28:8). Through Ezekiel, He also described as a “righteous person” the one who did not charge usury or excessive interest (Ezek. 18:8, 13, 17; 22:12). Likewise, in the parable of the talents, Jesus implied that interest on a business investment was not unlawful: “Then you ought to have put my money in the bank, and on my arrival I would have received my money back <em>with interest</em>.” (Matt. 25:27; Lk. 19:23). Today, believers seem little concerned with the debate on where do draw the line in charging interest on a loan. They have discarded these rules in any context. Most believers either don’t know of these rules or the assume that Christ must have fulfilled them. Today, credit card companies are free to charge high interest rates to the poor. Some would say that high interest loans perform a valuable service for the poor. Yet, high interest loans place the poor into economic bondage. The Church must not stay silent while its poorest members become burdened by high interest debt. Are you placing yourself into economic bondage?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6. <span class="underline">God’s Rules for Redeeming Foreign Servants and Slaves</span>. Lev. 25:44-55.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The redemption of foreign slaves</span>. The only true slaves were persons from the pagan nations who were captured in battle after waging warfare against God’s people. There were also foreigners living in Israel who sold their labors. Yet, those individuals were still treated like Jewish indentured servants: “<sup>44 </sup><em>As for your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you. <sup>45 </sup>Then, too, it is out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you may gain acquisition, and out of their families who are with you, whom they will have produced in your land; they also may become your possession. <sup>46 </sup>You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one another</em>.” (Lev. 25:44-46). The release promised on the Sabbath years only mentioned the “Hebrews” (Ex. 21:2; Dt. 15:12). Although these verses referenced “permanent slaves,” the Jubilee year was an opportunity for the Jews to show mercy to release these persons. God wanted all persons freed from bondage.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Protections given to a Jewish servant or foreign slave of war</span>. Even though prisoners of war could become slaves, the Jews never engaged in the commerce of buying and selling slaves as did the nations around them (Lev. 25:44; Kaiser, et al. <em>Hard Sayings of the Bible</em> (Inter Varsity Press 1996) p. 149-50). For both prisoners of war and indentured servants, God required that these people be given protection. Among other things, prisoners of war and indentured servants were to be given time off from work to observe the Sabbath (Ex. 20:10; Dt. 5:14). No similar protection existed in the nations around Israel. God also required that an owner causing the death of a servant or slave be punished for murder, just like any other type of murder (Ex. 21:20). If a master injured a servant through abuse, He mandated that the servant be set free. The servant would be absolved of his or her debts (Ex. 21:26-27). No similar protections existed in any other society. God further required that believers help any person seeking to escape bondage: “You shall not hand over to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you.” (Dt. 23:15). Again, no similar protection for escaped slaves to avoid returning to their masters existed in the societies that surrounded Israel. Jesus later came to fulfill the Law by freeing all who are in bondage (Lk. 4:14-21). Thus, neither slavery no indentured servitude was an institution that God wanted or intended for mankind.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Christ is our kinsman redeemer</span>. Jesus was born as a human to be a kinsman redeemer for us. On the first day of His public ministry, He entered the synagogue and read from Isaiah 61:1-2. After reading the passage, “<em>He has come to proclaim release to the captives . . . to set free those who are oppressed</em>,” Jesus proclaimed: “<em>Today, this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing</em>.” (Lk 4:14-21). Based upon records created by the Jewish historian Titus Josephus, Jesus most likely read these passages during a Jubilee year. This also again shows that slavery was never part of God’s plan. Jesus’ second return will free any slaves who might still be held captive.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Calculation of the redemption price</span>. Because God is just, He provided rules for making sure that a person who was owed money was properly compensated by a kinsman redeemer. The redemption price was calculated based upon the number of years remaining until the next Sabbath or Jubilee year: “<sup><em>4</em>7 </sup><em>‘Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes sufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as to sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the descendants of a stranger’s family, <sup>48 </sup>then he shall have redemption right after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, <sup>49 </sup>or his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. <sup>50 </sup>He then with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond to the number of years. It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be with him. <sup>51 </sup>If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption; <sup>52 </sup>and if few years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In proportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption. <sup>53 </sup>Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule over him with severity in your sight. <sup>54 </sup>Even if he is not redeemed by these means, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with him. <sup>55 </sup>For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> your God</em>.” (Lev. 25:47-55). The lesson is that your freedom does not include injuring another person. Whenever possible, your loans should be repaid.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s requirement that the Jews help prevent freed servants from returning to bondage</span>. Because God did not want His people to be in bondage, He further required that any freed servant be given the means to support himself or herself after being freed: “When you set him free, you shall not send him away empty-handed. You shall furnish him liberally from your flock and from your threshing floor and from your wine vat; you shall give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you.” (Dt. 15:13-15). To prevent the poor from being sold as servants, Solomon recruiting them to work for the government (1 Kgs. 9:22). Solomon showed the way for civil government to provide for the needs of the poor to keep them from selling themselves. In the New Testament, the early Church members also prevented others from falling into poverty by selling their things when needed to give to those who were need (Acts 2:32-45). Through these examples, God showed His plan for government and the Church to help prevent economic bondage.</p></li>

<p>7) <span class="underline">Through Christ, Seven Ways to Live Free from Your Prior Bondage</span>.</p>
<p>(1) <span class="underline">Be a slave or bondservant to righteousness</span>. One of the most important lessons from this chapter is to understand that Jesus as your kinsman redeemer has bought your immediate freedom. You don’t need to wait until a Sabbath or Jubilee year to be freed from your bondage. What then should you do you do with your freedom? The Bible is clear that if you use your freedom to sin, you will become enslaved again by your sins. Thus, you should instead use your freedom to pursue God’s righteousness: “Do you not know that when you present yourselves to someone as slaves for obedience, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or of obedience resulting in righteousness?” (Ro. 6:16). “Jesus answered them, ‘Truly, truly, I say to you, <em>everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin</em>.”’ (Jo. 8:34). If a servant wanted to stay with his or her master, God allowed the servant to do so. He or she became a “bondservant.” (Dt. 15:16-18). In return for a life time of service, the master would take care of the slave in his or her old age. If you take your freedom and give it up to become a slave to Christ, He will take care of you for eternity. In Greek, Paul referred to himself as a “<em>doulos</em>.” As properly translated by the NASB and the NKJ, he was a “bondservant” or the Lord’s slave: “Paul, <em>a bond-servant of Christ Jesus</em>, called as an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,” (Rom. 1:1; Phil. 1:1; 1 Pet. 2:16; 1 Cor. 7:22). Are you a <em>doulos</em> or slave to Christ? Or, are you still enslaved to the world?</p>
<p>(2) <span class="underline">Be free of high interest debt</span>. As stated above, God’s perfect Law prohibited “usurious interest.” (Lev. 25:36). The devil, however, will try to enslave you with high interest debt. God will provide for your needs, not your wants (Matt. 6:25-34). Are you keeping yourself free from high interest debt which could place you into bondage?</p>
<p>(3) <span class="underline">Make a covenant with your eyes to keep yourself pure</span>. To keep yourself freed from spiritual bondage, you must guard what you fill your mind with. Part of the definition of “true religion” is keeping yourself “unstained” by the sins of the world (Jam. 1:27). Jesus also warns that: “The eye is the lamp of your body; when your eye is clear, your whole body also is full of light; but when it is bad, your body also is full of darkness.” (Lk. 11:34). How do you keep your eyes pure? Job said that he created a “covenant with his eyes” to guard himself from looking at the wrong things (Job 31:1). Have you placed any limitations on what you look at? Do you have an accountability partner?</p>
<p>(4) <span class="underline">Let God’s Word be a light unto your feet</span>. To keep yourself free from bondage, you should also read the Bible. God will use His Word as a “light unto your feet.” (Ps. 119:105). Are you reading the Word on a regular basis for God to make your path clear?</p>
<p>(5) <span class="underline">Be in constant prayer</span>. To let the Holy Spirit guide you, you should also be in constant prayer. Through prayer, the Spirit will give you wisdom to stay on the right path (Jam. 1:5; Prov. 2:6). Are you praying on a regular basis for guidance?</p>
<p>(6) <span class="underline">Deny yourself.</span> To stay free from bondage, Jesus also says that you should “deny yourself.” (Lk. 9:23). This includes avoiding bad company (1 Cor. 15:33). Are you giving in to every desire of your flesh? Do you ever fast to feed the Spirit?</p>
<p>(7) <span class="underline">Make your life a “living sacrifice” for Christ</span>. Finally, Paul exhorts every believer to make their life a “living sacrifice” for God (Ro. 12:1). This includes seeking to serve Him out of gratitude, being holy, going to church, worshiping, praying, attending a small group, helping others, tithing, forgiving others, fidelity, teaching, showing love to others, including those who hurt you, exhibiting the fruit of the Spirit, mentoring others, fulfilling God’s calling in your life, practicing justice and mercy, spreading the Gospel, and freeing others from bondage. Are you living as a sacrifice for God or for yourself?</p>
