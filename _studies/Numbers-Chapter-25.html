<p><strong>Numbers Chapter 12: Don’t Gossip About or Covet the Authority of God’s Appointed Leaders</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. <span class="underline">Don’t Gossip About God’s Appointed Leaders</span>. Nu. 12:1.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">Racial prejudice is a sin</span>. Miriam and Aaron, the sister and brother of Moses, complained because Moses married a “Cushite” from Ethiopia. In other words, they complained because she was black. The Bible does to reveal what happened to his first wife Zipporah. Many imagine that God somehow condoned racism because people have misused the Bible to enslave others based upon their race. Not so. That is one of the many lies of the devil that he has used to defame God. From Moses’ example, we also know that interracial marriage amongst believers is allowed. When was the last time you heard someone cite this verse and God’s punishment that followed to show that He is against mankind’s racism? If people knew the Word, Satan would not have the opportunity to defame God. The Bible says that we are to be prepared to explain the hope that lies within us (1 Pet. 3:15). The Bible also warns against those who call evil good and good evil (Is. 5:20). Now, more than ever before, the Bible is under attack both by the world and sadly even within the Church. There are those who call some parts of God’s Word evil. Are you prepared to defend the Word from the devil’s lies?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">Valid criticisms should be brought directly to the leader’s attention</span>. Moses was not without sin. He had just complained about the burdens of leadership, and he showed a lack of faith in God’s ability to provide only one or two days into their journey (Nu. 11:10-15, 21-22). God also gives us an example of how He expected valid criticisms to be brought the attention of Moses. Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, complained to him that it was not right for him to assume responsibility for mediating every dispute amongst the people. He advised Moses to teach God’s Law to men who feared God. They could mediate the disputes (Ex. 18:17-27). According to Christ, when you have a valid criticism against a leader or anyone else, you are to speak confidentially and directly to the person who is engaged in sin (Matt. 18:15-20). When you have a dispute, are you bringing it up directly with that person. Or, do you spread gossip and complain to others?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">The accuser of the brethren is the Devil</span>. God called Satan “the accuser of the brethren.” (Rev. 12:10). Satan seeks to condemn each and every one of us before God (Job 1:6, 9-11; Zech 3:1). Like Satan, a person who spreads slander is called “a fool” in the Bible (Prov. 10:18). Slander is one of the signs of a “depraved mind” (Rom. 1:28-30).</strong> Thus, you should not speak ill about a person to other people (Ps. 15:3; 50:19-20; Prov. 6:16-19; Jam. 4:11). <strong>If you slander others, you cannot abide with God (Ps. 15:3; Prov. 10:31). When you gossip about others and slander them, the devil becomes your father: “</strong>You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.” (Jo. 8:44). Have you repented of your gossip and slander of others?</p></li>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">A prophet is without honor in his own family or town</span>. Because Miriam helped raise Moses, she knew him as the Egyptian he was, not the man of God he became after 40 years in the wilderness. Aaron also knew Moses as a young man. Both Miriam and Aaron also lived in slavery while Moses was raised within Pharaoh’s court and later while Moses lived as a free man in Midian (Ex. 4:19). The people of Nazareth, Jesus’ home town, heard Him preach the Word. Yet, they refused to believe Him because they knew him as a child (Matt. 13:53-58). If you have a family member who is hardened to Jesus, don’t be discouraged if they refuse to accept your testimony. Are you praying for God to bring different persons to explain the truth to them?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. <span class="underline">Don’t Covet the Authority Given to God’s Appointed Leaders</span>. Nu. 12:2-3.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">Pride can cause covetousness</span>. Miriam’s racist complaint was really a pretext to justify her prideful lust for power. Both felt entitled to power because God had spoken through them in the past. After Moses complained about his speaking skills, God spoke through Aaron to confront Pharaoh (Ex. 4:10, 30). God also spoke directly to Aaron on several occasions (Ex. 4:27-28; 12:1; Lev. 10:8; 11:1; 13:1; 14:33; 15:1). After God crushed Pharaoh’s army at the Red Sea, He called Miriam a “prophetess” as she sang words of praise to Him (Ex. 15:20). Their pride after having spoken with God fueled their lust for Moses’ power. They coveted what Moses had, even though the sin of coveting violated the Tenth Commandment (</strong>Ex. 20:17). <strong>Satan was likewise blessed with great beauty as one of God’s angels. His pride also caused him to covet God’s power (Is. 14:12-15).</strong> But those who “covet” are disqualified from inheriting the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:10; Eph. 5:3-6). <strong>Pride can also lead to your downfall (Prov. 16:18). Are you content with what you have? Or, do you covet what others have?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Coveting cannot be satisfied by giving in to temptation</span>. If Moses had agreed to share power with Aaron and Miriam, that would not have satisfied their desire for power. The coveting that the devil offers can only be satisfied through more coveting (Heb. 11:25; Lk. 12:19-20). “And the dogs are greedy, they are not satisfied. And they are shepherds who have no understanding; they have all turned to their own way, each one to his unjust gain, to the last one.” (Is. 56:11; Hab. 2:5). “Sheol, and the barren womb, earth that is never satisfied with water, and fire that never says, ‘Enough’.” (Prov. 30:16). Are you giving in to your temptations?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Coveting is a sin of the heart that leads to more serious sins when left unchecked</span>. Coveting, like the other Ten Commandment, are sins of the heart that defile us. Jesus warned: “For from within, <em>out of the heart of men, proceed the evil thoughts</em>, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, <em>deeds of coveting</em> <em>and</em> wickedness, <em>as well as</em> deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride <em>and</em> foolishness. All these evil things proceed from within and <em>defile the man</em>.” (Mk. 7:21-23). God prohibits coveting because it leads to other more serious sins. Moreover, these lusts put you in communion with the father of the world, not your Father in heaven: “For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world.” (1 Jo. 2:16). Every believer is at times guilty of this sin (Rom. 3:20). Jesus and Paul analogized sin to yeast, the fastest growing micro-organism (Mk. 8:15; 1 Cor. 5:7-8). If you are entertaining small sins of the flesh, will they stay small for long?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Coveting co-governance with God’s leaders is also contrary to God’s plan</span>. Like Miriam, Aaron, and Satan, you are susceptible to pride when you think that you can do something better than your church leaders. Democracy is the best form of civil government. Many therefore assume that it must also be the best form of religious governance. But we are to be imitators of Christ’s leadership (1 Thess. 1:6; 1 Cor. 11:1). We are not to follow the doctrines of men (Col. 2:8). God shows that He leads through one leader at a time. Christ had 12 apostles. But Christ never allowed any of them to dictate what He did. For example, when Peter tried to correct Christ in his claim that He needed to die, Christ called him “Satan” (Matt. 16:21-23; Mk. 8:33). Likewise, Moses was given 70 elders to delegate governing duties (Nu. 11:16). But he did not depend upon them in deciding where to go or what to do. The Holy Spirit led him by the pillar of light. In addressing this subject, Charles Spurgeon once famously remarked: “Every now and then we hear some simpleton or other talking against a ‘one-man ministry,’ when it has been a one-man ministry from the commencement of the world to the present day; and whenever you try to have any other form of ministry, and doing it thoroughly and heartily and independently and bravely in the sight of God, you very soon run upon quicksands.” (Spurgeon, <em>A Cheery Word In Troublous Times</em>). Have you complained that your church leader fails to share authority with others? Do you think you could do better? If so, those complaints are not from God.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">To fight pride and covetousness, fear God</span>. The moment Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, God heard it (Nu. 12:2). He is all knowing. Miriam and Aaron did not fear God. Both had witnessed Him destroy Pharaoh’s armies. They both witnessed 3,000 people die after Aaron succumbed to peer pressure and built the golden calf</strong> (Ex. 32:26-28). <strong>Aaron was the high priest who knew the Ten Commandments. This shows that head knowledge of the Bible is not alone enough to ward off pride. Aaron’s example shows us that head knowledge can sometimes make the pride harder to see.</strong> Even Solomon, the wisest man alive and the author of most of the proverbs, gave in to his covetousness and lusts when he had 700 wives and 300 concubines (1 Kgs. 11:1-8). <strong>The best way protect against pride is to be humble and fear God (Prov. 1:7; Rom 7:7). The fear of God is defined in the Bible as “hating” evil (Prov. 8:12). Do you hate it when you desire something that is not of God?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">To fight covetousness, deny yourself physical pleasures and covet the things of God</span>. Jesus reveals that to follow Him you should deny yourself certain worldly pleasures: “Then Jesus said to His disciples, ‘If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must deny himself, and take up his cross and follow Me. For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it; but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?”’ (Matt. 16:24-26). The one thing in life that you should covet is a deeper relationship with God: “As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants for You, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?” (Ps. 42:1-2; Matt. 6:6; 19-24; 13:44-46; 1 Cor. 12:31; Phil. 3:7-14). The Bible reveals that “godliness with contentment” is “great gain” (1 Tim. 6:6; Heb. 13:5). Are you content seeking to draw closer to God?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">To stay humble, praise God for your underserved gifts</span>. Joshua is believed to have added to the Bible that Moses was the most humble man on the planet (Nu. 12:3). Moses did not covet his authority (Nu. 11:11). Although Miriam and Aaron raised false charges, Moses knew that he was guilty under the Law of more serious charges. Among other things, Moses was guilty of murder and therefore had no reason to feel self-righteous</strong> (Ex. 2:11-12). <strong>To keep yourself humble like Moses, give praise for all your gifts and your accomplishments to God (1 Cor. 9:15; Col. 3:17, 23). Every good and perfect gift in your life comes from above (Jam. 1:17). Are you taking credit for your accomplishments? Or, are you giving the praise over to God?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. <span class="underline">Don’t Defend Yourself When You Are Falsely Accused</span>. Nu. 12:4-9.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">Let the Holy Spirit be your voice through silence</span>. God warns that the gentiles will slander you, even when you do good (1 Pet. 2:12). Moses never complained when the charges of Miriam and Aaron were made known to him (Nu. 12:5-8). Jesus was also silent when the false charges were leveled against Him (Matt. 26:62-63; Mk. 14:60-61; Lk. 23:8-10; Is. 53:7). Vengeance belongs to Him alone (Dt. 32:35; Ro. 12:19). When you try to defend yourself, the ugly sin of pride is likely to emerge. When you “keep a good conscious” in the face of slander, God promises to put to shame those who slander you: “</strong>and keep a good conscience so that in the thing in which you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ will be put to shame.” <strong>(1 Pet. 3:16). Do you fight back when you are defamed? Are you given your battles over to God?</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. <span class="underline">God Exposes Our Sins to Bring Us to Repentance</span>. Nu. 12:10.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">Our hearts are wicked</span>. Miriam</strong> was given leprosy because she instigated a rebellion against Moses’ leadership (Nu. 12:10). In Hebrew, the verb for spoke in verse 12:1 is the third person female. Thus, the Bible reveals that she started the complaints against Moses. God also used leprosy to punish others for their sin. For example, when King Uzziah tried to take on the roles of both king and high priest (which God had separated), his punishment was leprosy (2 Chr. 26:19-21). Sin, like leprosy, also causes the victim to become numb to their pain (Eph. 4:10; 1 Tim. 4:2). A victim of leprosy will eventually die if untreated. Sin, like leprosy, will lead to death (Ro. 6:23). <strong>Jesus says that “slander” is one of the evils that come from “the heart of men.” (Mk. 7:21-22).</strong> When God turned Miriam white as snow, a stage of advanced leprosy, He was showing her that her heart was deeply wicked (Jer. 17:9). Are you asking God to search out your heart and reveal your wickedness? When He does reveal sin, do you repent of it?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Only Jesus can cure our sin</span>. The priests could only quarantine. By contrast, Jesus’ first recorded miracle in the book of Matthew was healing a leper (Matt. 8:2-3). By this miracle, He demonstrated that He has the power to heal sin. When you repent, He is faithful to forgive (1 Jo. 1:9). Are you turning to Him to be cleansed of your sin.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. <span class="underline">Repent of Your Sins</span>. Nu. 12:11-12.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">The penalty of coveting is death</span>.</strong> The penalty under the law for both Miriam and Aaron for coveting power was death (Jam. 1:14-15; <strong>Heb. 10:28</strong>). God could have struck both down for their sins. Instead, out of mercy and grace, He gave them both a chance to repent <strong>(Matt. 3:2). Yet, those who fail to repent will face judgment (Lk. 13:3-5). Are you giving thanks for what Christ has spared you from?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">True repentance causes us to change our behavior</span>. Paul tells us to put away “all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander . . .” (Eph. 4:31; same, Col. 3:8; 1 Pet. 2:1, 12). Can we say that we have repented if we continue to slander and covet?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">If Aaron was qualified to be a priest, so are you</span>. Like all of us, Aaron was a flawed person. He built the golden calf (Ex. 32:1-6, 35). When Moses confronted him, he blamed the people for his own actions instead of repenting (<strong>Ex. 32:22-24). The Bible tells us that God would have destroyed Aaron if Moses had not intervened on his behalf (Dt. 9:20).</strong> After Aaron’s sons died for their disobedience, he violated God’s direction that a sacrifice be eaten in the sanctuary. He also violated God’s direction that Aaron not mourn the death of his sons (Lev. 10:16-20). Out of pride and coveting power, he criticized Moses. Moreover, he repented only after seeing Miriam punished, a punishment he knew that he deserved (Nu. 12:11-12). We are all part of God’s holy priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:6). If God could use Aaron as a high priest, do you have any valid excuse for refusing to serve?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. <span class="underline">Forgive and Pray For Those Who Persecute You</span>. Nu. 12:13-16.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">God hears righteous prayers for others</span>. Job prayed for his friends (Job 42:10). Moses also prayed for Miriam and saved her (Nu. 12:11). When Moses pleaded for God to spare the people after they built the golden calf, God did so (Ex. 32:14). Jesus likewise tells us “Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.” (Matt. 5:44). Are you praying for forgiveness for others who have fallen into sin?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">Comfort those under punishment</span>. The entire nation knew of Miriam’s shame. Even though forgiven, there were consequences for her actions. The same is true with us when we sin. God, however, showed compassion upon Miriam. The entire nation waited at God’s direction to continue on until Miriam was healed (Nu. 12:15). We are also to treat those under rebuke with tenderness and not as enemies (2 Thess. 3:15). God expects you to pay back the comfort you receive from Him by comforting others (2 Cor. 2:7;</strong> Eph. 4:32). Are you comforting those who are being punished for their sins? For example, have you ever gone to a jail to pray for a prisoner?</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>7. <span class="underline">Those Who Deny the Messiah Must Also Repent</span>. Nu. 12:8; Heb. 10:28-29</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">Moses foreshadows Christ</span>. God promised: “I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth . . .” (Dt. 18:18). Here, Moses foreshadowed Jesus. God struck Miriam with leprosy for her unfounded gossip and criticism of Moses. In a similar way, the Jews rejected Jesus. They were also jealous of His following. Nonbelievers who reject God’s Law will face punishment (Heb. 10:28). A nonbeliever who rejects Christ will face an even greater punishment: “</strong>How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?<strong>” (Heb. 10:29). Are you praying for the nonbelievers around you to accept Christ as their Lord and Savior?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong><span class="underline">You will one day enjoy the same access Moses did to God</span>. A human cannot see God in his or her sinful form and live (Ex. 33:20). Thus, God speaks to some through dreams or visions (Job 4:16; Judg. 14:12; 1 K. 10:1). By contrast, God spoke “mouth to mouth” with Moses (Nu. 12:8; Ex. 4:12; 33:11; Dt. 34:10). You also will one day be able see God face to face just as Moses did (1 Cor. 13:12;</strong> Rev. 22:4). Are you giving thanks for the unearned joy that awaits you in heaven?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>1 Pet. 5:6).</p>
<p><span class="underline">To restore fellowship, remove the things that cause your flesh to stumble</span>. Taking the flesh outside the camp and burning it was symbolic of removing from a believer’s life the things that cause the flesh to stumble. Christ was killed outside the camp of Jerusalem on Calvary Hill to fulfill this Law. “For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp. Therefore Jesus also, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate. So, let us go out to Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach.” (Heb. 13:11-13). We also need to remove those things from our life that cause us to stumble: “If your right eye makes you stumble tear it out and throw it from you; for it is better for you to lose one of the parts of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.” (Matt. 5:29). Are you still entertaining things in your life that cause you to stumble? If the internet is causing you to stumble, set filters and have someone else keep the password. If there are friends who cause you to drink, take drugs, steal, or use profanity, stop hanging out with them.</p>
<p>4. <span class="underline">To Restore Fellowship, We Must Also Pray for the Sins of the Nation, the States, the Communities, and the Churches</span>. Lev. 4:13-21.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Leviticus 4:13-21</span>: <em><sup>13 </sup>‘Now if the whole congregation of Israel commits error and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they commit any of the things which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has commanded not to be done, and they become guilty; <sup>14 </sup>when the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the assembly shall offer a bull of the herd for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting. <sup>15 </sup>Then the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and the bull shall be slain before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. <sup>16 </sup>Then the anointed priest is to bring some of the blood of the bull to the tent of meeting; <sup>17 </sup>and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, in front of the veil. <sup>18 </sup>He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar which is before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> in the tent of meeting; and all the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the doorway of the tent of meeting. <sup>19 </sup>He shall remove all its fat from it and offer it up in smoke on the altar. <sup>20 </sup>He shall also do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering; thus he shall do with it. So the priest shall make atonement for them, and they will be forgiven. <sup>21 </sup>Then he is to bring out the bull to a place outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.</em></p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The sins of the nations, the states, communities, and the churches also require a sin offering</span>. Here, God reveals that the sins of the nation, the state, the community, or the congregation can also break our fellowship with God. Without a sin offering for these peoples: “they become guilty.” (Lev. 4:13). This includes believers today. If the Church ignores the sins of the world around it, its fellowship with Christ will be broken. If this seems hard to understand, we need only look at the nation of Israel. It was sent into captivity because of its disobedience. The righteous people like Daniel did not get to stay in Israel. They paid for the collective sins of the nation. Likewise, we can see how righteous people today suffer when an entire nation sins. As one example, if a nation over consumes with debt. Eventually, a bubble will form in either the stock market or the real estate market. The bubble will then burst. The values of stocks, homes, or both will plunge in value. Thousands of people, including righteous ones, will lose their jobs. Likewise, if a church becomes divided with one group seeking to follow public opinion with another seeking to follow the Word, the church will eventually divide and become engaged in strife (Matt. 12:25; Mark 3:24). As God’s “nation of priests” (1 Pet. 2:5), all believers have a responsibility to pray for the sins of the nation. Like Jonah, believers need to learn that part of our calling as a nation of priests is to be burdened by the sins of the nation, the state, our communities, and our churches. What breaks God’s heart must break our hearts as well. You further cannot look to public opinion polls to determine His will. “For My thoughts are not your thoughts, Nor are your ways My ways," declares the LORD.” (Is. 55:8). You must instead let the Word and the Spirit guide what is right and wrong in your life. Are you burdened by the nation’s sins around you? Are you and others in your church praying and fasting for your nation?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Intercessory prayer works through the blood of Christ</span>. The priest sacrificed a bull for the nation, the state, the community, and the congregation (Lev. 4:14). The blood on the horns was a powerful and sweet aroma to God. Our intercessory prayers today create that powerful aroma: “Then he will pray to God, and He will accept him, that he may see his face with joy, and he may restore His righteousness to man.” (Job 22:26). “O God of hosts, restore us and cause Your face to shine upon us, and we will be saved.” (Ps. 80:19). There are many examples in the Bible where God relented after intercessory prayer. God relented from destroying Israel because Moses stood in the breach on multiple occasions and prayed for the nation. For example, he saved the nation after they made the golden calf (Ex. 32:11-14). He saved them when they murmured against God (Nu. 11:2). His prayers also saved the nation when the Jews rebelled at the edge of the promised land (Nu. 14:18-22). His prayers, along with Aaron’s prayers, also saved the nation after they rebelled regarding Korah’s death (Nu. 16:21-24). Is your faith in the power of intercessory prayer weak? How often do you pray for the nation, the states, the communities, and those around you?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Christ forgave the Jews when they rebelled against Him</span>. One of Christ’s last seven statements before His death was the following prayer: “Father forgive them for they known not what they do.” (Luke 23:34). Christ had the power to forgive the rebels who killed Him, even though they did not repent. If God the Father forgave the Jews’ rebellions in response to Moses’ prayers, should we doubt that He did after Christ’s prayer?</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline"><em>Yom Kippur</em> – the national day of intercessory prayer</span>. Christians can pray for the nation any day they want to. Yet, with the freedom to pray any day, many Christians never pray at all. <em>Yom Kippur</em> was the day that God appointed for prayers for the nation. Christians are freed of any obligation to observe <em>Yom Kippur</em> (Col. 2:16). God does not want any worship made out of obligation. Yet, <em>Yom Kippur</em> has still has two important purposes for Christians. First, if you lack the discipline to pray and fast for the nation on other days, it is God’s national day of prayer for believers to pray for others and the nation. Second, it is the day God appointed for believers to voluntarily give thanks to Christ for doing what we cannot do on our own. To understand this, we must realize that <em>Yom Kippur</em> brought together (1) the holiest man, (2) in the holiest place, (3) on the holiest day. The High Priest was to go alone into the Tent of Meeting to intercede on behalf of the people (Lev. 16:17-18). Today, Jesus is our High Priest (Heb. 8:1-2). He is the one and only mediator between man and God (1 Tim. 2:5). While the High Priests of the Old Testament could only enter the Holy of Holies once per year (Lev. 16:29), Jesus sits in the Holy of Holies interceding <em>daily</em> on our behalf (Heb. 9:1-10). We in turn are called upon to intercede for others. Christ’s death tore from top to bottom the “veil” of the Holy of Holies that separates us from God (Matt. 27:51; Mk. 15:38). According to the Midrash, the High Priest had to wear a rope to be pulled out in case he died inside the Holy of Holies as a result of failing to properly follow God’s procedures. By contrast, we can now enter the Holy of Holies with “boldness” to pray for others. “Having therefore, brethren, <em>boldness</em> to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh; and <em>having</em> an high priest over the house of God;” (Heb. 10:19-22 (KJV)). With this special access that Christ made possible, He wants you to “boldly” pray for your nation. Are you doing you part? Or, do you lack the faith to believe that your prayers matter?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">We must petition to remove that which is wrong in the nation</span>. The sin offering for the nation also required that the flesh be removed from the camp (Lev. 4:21). The fat was given to God (Lev. 4:19). We need to do more than just pray. We must also be active in politics to remove the things in our nation, state, or community which cause people to sin against God. When our churches deviate from the Word, we must also bring our leaders back to the Word: “We must obey God rather than men.” (Acts 5:29). In other words, we must be salt and light to those around us (Matt. 5:13-14). Are you and your church an irritant in the wound of sin when others sin around you?</p></li>

<p>5. <span class="underline">The Sins of the Leaders</span>. Leviticus 4:22-26.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Leviticus 4:22-26</span>: “<em><sup>22 </sup>‘When a leader sins and unintentionally does any one of all the things which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> his God has commanded not to be done, and he becomes guilty, <sup>23</sup> if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring for his offering a goat, a male without defect. <sup>24 </sup>He shall lay his hand on the head of the male goat and slay it in the place where they slay the burnt offering before the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>; it is a sin offering. <sup>25 </sup>Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering. <sup>26 </sup>All its fat he shall offer up in smoke on the altar as in the case of the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin, and he will be forgiven.</em>” (Lev. 4:22-26).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The sins of our leaders can also break our fellowship</span>. God also reveals that a leader who sins requires a sin offering. The priest was to sacrifice a male goat without defect (Lev. 4:23). Our leaders are appointed by God (Rom. 13:1). We are required to obey our leaders and serve them: “Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls . . .” (Heb. 13:17; see also, 1 Tim. 6:1-5; Eph. 6:5; Col. 3:22-4:1). A leader who sins can affect our fellowship. For example, when a church leader sins, the church frequently breaks up. The sins of a President can also bring down a nation. President Nixon’s sins at Watergate, for example, brought the nation into a malaise. President Clinton’s sexual sins and alleged perjury following the initial sin also divided the nation. Thus, we must also pray that God will forgive and restore our civic leaders.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Our leaders must also break from their sins</span>. The sacrifice for the leader was the goat. The sins of the leader were cast onto the goat and driven away (Lev. 4:24). A leader must also cast off his sins. The leader gave up the fat in his or her life (Lev. 4:26). The restoration of a leader will not only prevent the group from falling down, it can restore others as well: “Then, I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning, <em>after that</em> you will call the city of righteousness a faithful city.” (Isa. 1:26). Thus, our prayers should also include a request that the leader repent and be restored to help others.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>6. <span class="underline">The Sins of the Average Member of the Community</span>. Leviticus 4:27-35.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Leviticus 4:27-35</span>: “<em><sup>27 </sup>‘Now if anyone of the common people sins unintentionally in doing any of the things which the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty, <sup>28 </sup> if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without defect, for his sin which he has committed. <sup>29 </sup>He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slay the sin offering at the place of the burnt offering. <sup>30 </sup>The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar. <sup>31 </sup>Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat was removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar for a soothing aroma to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven. <sup>32 </sup>‘But if he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring it, a female without defect. <sup>33 </sup>He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they slay the burnt offering. <sup>34 </sup>The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and all the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar. <sup>35 </sup>Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, and the priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar, on the offerings by fire to the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>. Thus the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin which he has <sup>[</sup>committed, and he will be forgiven</em>.” (Lev. 4:27-35.)</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">The sins of those around us can affect us</span>. When a co-worker, a neighbor, a school mate, or a friend sins, those sins can also break our fellowship with God. The offering for the average citizen who sinned was a female goat or lamb without defect (Lev. 4:28, 32). We must pray for those around us to cast off their sins (the goat and the fat offering) and submit to the will of God (the lamb offering). As a nation of priests, we must be burdened for all those around us. We must keep our co-workers, our neighbors, our colleagues, and others in prayer.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Seek to restore a sinner out of love</span>. Our goal should never be to condemn a sinner. That is what Satan does as the accuser of the brethren (Rev. 12:10). Instead, our goal should be to <em>restore</em> the person who has sinned: “Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restores such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted.” (Gal. 6:1). If we have no interest in restoring a sinner or if we just enjoy the challenge of debating a sinner, there is no love within us.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>7. <span class="underline">Restoration Requires Obedience</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s sacrifices were specific</span>. God offered a detailed way for us to restore fellowship. Primarily, this involves the blood of Christ. First we accept Him as our Lord and Savior (the burnt offering). Second, we offer our lives as a living sacrifice (the grain offering). Third, we draw close daily, purify ourselves, and deny ourselves (the peace offering). When we sin as believers, we confess our sins. We also pray for the sins of the nation, the states, the churches, the leaders, and the people around us (the sin offering). God gave us a detailed way to find and then restore our fellowship with Him after we sin. We cannot expect to restore fellowship if we refuse to follow the path that God has set for us.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God promises restoration for those who obey Him</span>. We cannot find or restore this fellowship if we refuse to be obedient: “<em>If</em> you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments so as to carry them out, then I shall give you rains in their season, so that the land will yield its produce and the trees of the field will bear their fruit . . .I shall also grant you peace in the land.” (Lev. 26:3-6). “All these blessings will come upon you and overtake you if you obey the Lord your God.” (Dt. 28:2). These blessings include the promise of restoration after sin: “Therefore, thus says the Lord, ‘If you return, then I will restore you . . .” (Jer. 15:19). Our nation can also be restored to its greatness if it will repent and follow God’s law: “Now it shall be, <em>if</em> you diligently obey the Lord your God, being careful to do all His commandments which I command you today, the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth.” (Dt. 28:1). Many of the founders of America were God-fearing people. They sought after God in all the decisions that they made. The stated in the Declaration of Independence that their laws and their freedoms all came from God. As part of God’s nation of priests, you can be praying for a revival and stay engaged in politics and by being His salt and light (Matt. 5:13-14).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A person could not find it by choosing to do whatever he or she wants. To find peace we must follow God’s law. Jesus stated that if we love Him, we will keep His commandments (Jo. 14:15). That alone should be sufficient motive for us to obey God’s commandments. But God also promised the blessing of peace for those who were willing to follow God’s law: “I shall also grant peace in the land, so that you may lie down with no one making you tremble.” (Lev. 26:6). “The LORD will bless His people with peace.” (Ps. 29:1). If the Jews followed God’s law, God also promised victory over their enemies (Lev. 26:7-8; Ex. 23:22; Nu 10:9, 35; Isa. 54:17). If we trust God and follow His commandments, Jesus promises us the peace that surpasses all understanding (Phil 4:7). This peace and other blessings are also available to nations that are obedient: “I shall also grant peace in the land, so that you may lie down with no one making <em>you</em> tremble. I shall also eliminate harmful beasts from the land, and no sword will pass through your land.” (Lev. 26:6; Ex. 18:23; Ps. 29:11). If you follow the Law, your conscious will be clean. You won’t need to be looking over your shoulder for when you might be punished for your misdeeds. Are you being obedient to God’s Word and His calling in your life?</p>
<p>7. <span class="underline">Principle No. 7 – To Find <em>Shalom</em>, You Must Search For Jesus with All Your Heart</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">To “dine” with Jesus, search for Him with all your heart</span>. The portions of the animal sacrificed were offered as a “food” offering to God (Lev. 3:11, 16). With the other offerings, the burned animal or grain was offered as a sweet aroma to the Lord. Some commentaries suggest that we should not take the food reference literally. But this is exactly what Jesus promised to the believers at the Church of Laodicea who responded to His knocking at the door of their hearts (Rev. 3:20). To allow Jesus to have an intimate relationship with us where we “dine” with Him, we must first allow Him into our hearts. “How blessed are those who observe His testimonies, who seek Him with all <em>their</em> heart.” (Ps. 119:2). “You will seek Me and find Me when you search for Me with all your heart.” (Jer. 29:13). “But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul.” (Dt. 4:29). Because Jesus made His offer to “dine” with believers, merely accepting Jesus as Lord and Savior is not enough. We must both surrender our hearts to Him and search for Him with all our hearts. What does this mean? It means that we should yearn to draw closer to Jesus. Also, what motivates or moves you would be what motivates or moves God. Do you long to study the Word? Does the sin around you break your heart? Or, do you enjoy reading about it and talking about it? Do you work to live? Or, do you work to support a ministry for God? Do you long to read the Word or Hollywood gossip?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">When you find peace with God, “dine” with Christ through communion</span>. Today, we dine with God when we eat communion. We remember that Christ’s body was broken for us and His blood was spilled for us (Matt. 26:26). “[A]nd when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.” (1 Cor. 11:24). Through Christ’s sacrifice, God has blessed us with a <em>shalom</em> that “surpasses all understanding.” (Phil. 4:7). Are you pursuing the peace that He offers you? Or, are you searching for peace through drugs, alcohol, and the things of the world?</p></li>
