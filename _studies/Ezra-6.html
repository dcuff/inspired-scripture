<p>1. ________________________________. Ezra 6:1-7.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">King Darius I reaffirms King Cyrus II’s decree to authorize the Temple rebuilding</span>. “<sup>1</sup> <em>Then King Darius issued a decree, and search was made in the archives, where the treasures were stored in Babylon. <sup>2 </sup>In Ecbatana in the fortress, which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found and there was written in it as follows: ‘Memorandum— <sup>3 </sup>In the first year of King Cyrus, Cyrus the king issued a decree: ‘Concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, let the temple, the place where sacrifices are offered, be rebuilt and let its foundations be retained, its height being 60 cubits and its width 60 cubits; <sup>4 </sup>with three layers of huge stones and one layer of timbers. And let the cost be paid from the royal treasury. <sup>5 </sup>Also let the gold and silver utensils of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be returned and brought to their places in the temple in Jerusalem; and you shall put them in the house of God.’’ <sup>6 </sup>Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai and your colleagues, the officials of the provinces beyond the River, keep away from there. <sup>7 </sup>Leave this work on the house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site</em>.” (Ezra 6:1-7).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Verses 1-12: The reference to “rolls” in verse 1 is to “archivers.” The “Achmetha” of verse 2 is Ecbatana the capital of the old Median Empire. The roll of verse 2 means a papyrus or leather scroll (a different Hebrew word), instead of the usual clay tablet. Verses 6-12 contain a strongly worded decree from Darius which reinforced the original one from Cyrus. The threat (in verse 11), is heightened by Herodotus’s account, which states that Darius impaled three thousand Babylonians after conquering their city.</p>
<p>Verses 1-2: “Babylon … Achmetha”: The Vulgate Latin version has it Ecbatana. Ecbatana was one of the Persian capitals, 300 miles northeast of Babylon in the foothills, where Cyrus and others had their summer homes.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:1 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.</strong></p>
<p>“Darius the king made a decree”: Rather than a public edict, this was a simple order issued to a small group of officials.</p>
<p>“Darius I”: (the great), is also known as Darius Hystaspis, or Darius, son of Hystaspis. He reigned over Persian from about 521 to 485 B.C. as one of the most able Persian kings. Darius continued Cyrus the Great’s policy of restoring the Jewish people to their homeland. In 520 B.C., Darius’s second year as king, the Jews resumed work on the still-unfinished temple in Jerusalem. Darius assisted by ordering the project to continue, even granting a generous subsidy to help revive temple worship (verses 1-12). The temple was completed in 516 B.C., in the sixth year of Darius’s reign. (Ezra 4:5-6; Hag. 1:1, 15; 2:10; Zech. 1:1, 7; 7:1).</p>
<p>This is saying that Darius sent orders for the records to be searched to see if such a decree had been made by Cyrus. They searched first in Babylon, but there was more than one place for the records that were kept. The record in Babylon was destroyed, if there was one.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:2 "And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that [is] in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein [was] a record thus written:"</strong></p>
<p>“Therein was a record thus written”: A particular kind of document called a memorandum (Ezra 4:15; Mal. 3:16). Administrative officials often kept these documents of administrative decisions made, or issues remaining to be settled, to retain the details of administrative action for future reference.</p>
<p>“Achmetha” (also called Ecbatana; modern-day Hamadan in Iran), was one of four cities that served as a capital in Persia. Its elevation (6,000 feet above sea level), provided an ideal climate for keeping royal records and scrolls.</p>
<p>This was a place in the province of the Medes. It was possibly, an extra copy of the decree that Cyrus had made. He was aware that one might be destroyed probably. Achmetha was the capital of northern Media. Cyrus the 2nd held his court here.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:3 "In the first year of Cyrus the king [the same] Cyrus the king made a decree [concerning] the house of God at Jerusalem, Let the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices, and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height thereof threescore cubits, [and] the breadth thereof threescore cubits;"</strong></p>
<p>“First year” (ca. 538 B.C.; compare 1:2-4).</p>
<p>“Thereof threescore cubits … threescore cubits”: These dimensions exceed those of Solomon’s temple (compare 1 Kings 6:2).</p>
<p>In this decree, we see more details than we had in the first chapter, where we read of Cyrus wanting to re-build the temple. They not only found the decree, but it spelled out exactly what was to be done.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:4 "[With] three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and let the expenses be given out of the king's house:"</strong></p>
<p>Which Jarchi interprets of the walls of it, and these stones of marble; and so Ben Melech.</p>
<p>"And a row of new timber": Of cedar wood upon the rows of stone (see 1 Kings 6:36), or for the lining and wainscoting the walls.</p>
<p>"And let the expenses be given out of the king's house": Treasury, or exchequer. But it does not appear that this part of the decree was observed, at least hitherto. But the Jews built at their own expense, and perhaps did not exactly observe the directions given as to the dimensions of the house.</p>
<p>Cyrus had given from his own treasury toward this building. The Jews had put money in on this themselves as well. It appears from this, however, that all expenses were to be paid for by Persia.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:5 "And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which [is] at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and brought again unto the temple which [is] at Jerusalem, [every one] to his place, and place [them] in the house of God."</strong></p>
<p>"And also let the golden and silver vessels . . . be restored": The desecration of these vessels by Belshazzar (Dan. 5:2-3), was thus to be atoned for. Every word, including the twice repeated “house of God,” is most emphatic.</p>
<p>And place them in the house of God": Thus far the decree of Cyrus is recited, which justified all the allegations of the Jews in the foregoing chapter. In the next verse the decree of Darius thereupon appears to begin.</p>
<p>“Nebuchadnezzar took” (see note on 1:7).</p>
<p>This also had been done with all of the vessels found that had been taken from the temple in Jerusalem, when Zerubbabel led the first group back to Judah.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Verses 6-12: God often uses unbelievers, like the pagan king Darius, to carry out His will (Isa. 46:10; Acts 4:24-28). In this case, the continued rebuilding of the temple affirmed God’s presence in Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:6 "Now [therefore], Tatnai, governor beyond the river, Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which [are] beyond the river, be ye far from thence:"</strong></p>
<p>The river Euphrates, which side of it was towards the land of Israel; Josephus calls this man master of the horse.</p>
<p>Shethar-boznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which are beyond the river, be ye far from thence. Keep at a distance from the Jews, and give them no disturbance, nor interrupt them in their work of building of the temple, but mind your own business and government.</p>
<p>Tatnai was not to have anything to do with stopping the work. Darius sent him word to leave them alone. The message in short was, "leave them alone".</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Verses 6-7: God so favored the Jews (compare 5:5), that, through Darius, He forbade the officials from interfering with the building project.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:7 "Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in his place.”</strong></p>
<p>Let them to go on with it, and do not hinder them. It looks, by these expressions, as if he had some suspicion or hint given him that they were inclined to molest them, or that there were some that stirred them up, and were desirous of it.</p>
<p>"Let the governor of the Jews, and the elders of the Jews, build this house of God in his place": Where it formerly stood; that is, go on with the building of it.</p>
<p>Darius warned Tatnai not to interfere in any way with the building of this temple. They were to be left alone to build the temple of God.</p>
<p>2. ________________________________. Ezra 6:8-11.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">King Darius I pledges Persian financial support for the Temple rebuilding</span>. “<sup>8<em> </em></sup><em>Moreover, I issue a decree concerning what you are to do for these elders of Judah in the rebuilding of this house of God: the full cost is to be paid to these people from the royal treasury out of the taxes of the provinces beyond the River, and that without delay. <sup>9 </sup>Whatever is needed, both young bulls, rams, and lambs for a burnt offering to the God of heaven, and wheat, salt, wine and anointing oil, as the priests in Jerusalem request, it is to be given to them daily without fail, <sup>10 </sup>that they may offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons. <sup>11 </sup>And I issued a decree that any man who violates this edict, a timber shall be drawn from his house and he shall be impaled on it and his house shall be made a refuse heap on account of this</em>.” (Ezra 6:8-11).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Verses 8-10: Not only could the officials not hinder the building, but they also had to help finance it by giving the Jews some of their portion of taxes collected for the Persian king. The Jews could draw from the provincial treasury.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:8 "Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the king's goods, [even] of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered."</strong></p>
<p>This must be considered as an additional decree of Darius, which was peculiarly made by him, in which more was granted in favor of the Jews, and as an encouragement to them to go on with the building of the temple. Though Josephus says this is nothing other than a confirmation of the decree of Cyrus; for, according to him, all that is here granted to them, or threatened to others, from hence to the end of (Ezra 6:10), was contained in the decree.</p>
<p>"That of the king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river": What was collected out of his dominions on that side the river Euphrates, towards the land of Israel. According to Herodotus, this Darius was the first of the kings of Persia that exacted tribute.</p>
<p>"That forthwith expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered": From going on with the building, for want of money to buy materials, and pay the workmen.</p>
<p>Darius commanded Tatnai to give the tribute money to them to pay their men for the work on the temple. They must not be hindered in this work. Darius would make sure they did everything that Cyrus promised to do.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:9 "And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which [are] at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail:"</strong></p>
<p>All which were used for burnt offerings (see Lev. 1:2).</p>
<p>"Wheat, salt, wine, and oil": "wheat", or "fine flour", for the "minchah" (the afternoon prayer service in Judaism), or meat offering; "salt", for every offering. Wine", for the drink offerings; and "oil", to be put upon the meat offerings (see Lev. 2:1).</p>
<p>“According to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail": For the daily sacrifice, and the meat and drink offerings which attended it (Exodus 29:38).</p>
<p>Somehow, he had to know which animals they used in sacrifice. These were to be given to them in abundance, so they would have enough for their sacrifices. They were to be fed of the king's supplies. This was to be seen after every single day.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:10 "That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savors unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons."</strong></p>
<p>“Pray for the life of the king, and of his sons”: This was essentially the same self-serving motive that prompted Cyrus to decree that all captured peoples should return to their countries, rebuild the temples that Nebuchadnezzar and others had destroyed, and placate the offended deities. He wanted all the gods on his side, including Israel’s God.</p>
<p>Darius wanted them to pray for him and his sons. He believed the power of their God was the true power.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:11 "Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a dunghill for this."</strong></p>
<p>“Pulled down … hanged … made a dunghill”: Typical punishment for a serious infraction (compare Rev. 22:18-19). This was specifically directed at the hostile Samaritans.</p>
<p>There would be no more opposition, because of the punishment to be inflicted on those who opposed the building of the temple.</p>
<p>3. ______________________________. Ezra 6:12.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">King Darius I declares that Yahweh’s name resided in the former Temple</span>. “<sup>12 </sup><em>May the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who attempts to change it, so as to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued this decree, let it be carried out with all diligence!</em>” (Ezra 6:12).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Verses 12-22: In this section, the temple is finished in the “sixth year of the reign of Darius” (March 12, 515 B.C.). While it was being built (the events of Zechariah chapter 7 occurred). They kept the “dedication “of the house of God with joy.” The word for “dedication” is <em>chenukah</em> (Hanukkah), which was later to become the name of a festival in memory of the temple’s re-consecration (in 165 B.C.), after its profanation by Antiochus Epiphanes. Solomon had offered more than two hundred times as many oxen and sheep at the dedication of his temple (1 Kings. 8:63, with 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep).</p>
<p>Beginning with (verse 19), the text is again in Hebrew. Verse 21 indicates two groups of people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(1) those who had returned from exile; and</p>
<p>(2) possibly a group of Jews who had not gone into captivity, or a group of proselytes (compare Exodus 12:44, 48).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reference to the “king of Assyria” is accurate because Darius was also the sovereign of Assyria, so he could easily have been called king of Assyria. There is a similar use of the term in a Babylonian king list which starts with the Assyrian Kandalanu, mentions the Chaldeans, Nabopolassar, and Nebuchadnezzar, then refers to Cyrus, Cambyses, and Darius, and ends with the names of Seleucid kings.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:12 "And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter [and] to destroy this house of God which [is] at Jerusalem. I Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed."</strong></p>
<p>Whose name is not only called upon there, and that called by his name; but who grants his presence, and causes his Shekinah, or divine Majesty. To dwell there, as in Solomon's temple, which Darius had some knowledge of.</p>
<p>"Destroy all kings and people": Let them be who they will, high or low.</p>
<p>"That shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of God, which is at Jerusalem": This he said to deter from hindering the building of it now, and from attempting to destroy it hereafter.</p>
<p>"I Darius have made a decree, let it be done with speed": Be carried immediately into execution, especially with respect to the disbursement for the building of the temple, and for the sacrifices of it.</p>
<p>The decree of Darius went even further than the decree of Cyrus. He was speaking of the One True God here. He called for God to destroy any king, or people, who came against the building of the temple.</p>
<p>4. ______________________________. Ezra 6:13-15.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The Jews complete the Temple</span>. “<sup>13 </sup><em>Then Tattenai, the governor of the province beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues carried out the decree with all diligence, just as King Darius had sent. <sup>14 </sup>And the elders of the Jews were successful in building through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they finished building according to the command of the God of Israel and the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. <sup>15 </sup>This temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar; it was the sixth year of the reign of King Darius</em>.” (Ezra 6:13-15).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:13 "Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shethar-boznai, and their companions, according to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily."</strong></p>
<p>Having received and read the above letter.</p>
<p>"According to that which Darius the king had sent, so they did speedily": Acquainted the Jews with what the king had written; were so far from hindering the work going forward, that they encouraged it. And made disbursements to them out of the king's tribute, and furnished them with everything necessary for sacrifice. And this they did immediately, without delay.</p>
<p>Tatnai did exactly as the king had commanded him to do.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:14 "And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they builded, and finished [it], according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia."</strong></p>
<p>“Prospered” (Haggai 1:7-11).</p>
<p>The Israelites “builded, and finished” the temple according to their highest authority: “the commandment of the God of Israel”.</p>
<p>“The commandment of the God of Israel … commandment of Cyrus”: This is not the normal term for command, but it is the same word translated “decree” or “administrative order” throughout the book. The message here is powerful. It was the decree from God, the Sovereign of the universe, which gave administrative authority to rebuild the temple. The decrees (same word), of 3 of the greatest monarchs in the history of the ancient Near East were only a secondary issue. God rules the universe and He raised up kings, then pulls them from their thrones when they have served His administration.</p>
<p>“Artaxerxes”: Although he did not contribute to the project under Zerubbabel, he did under Ezra (compare 7:11-26).</p>
<p>Haggai prophesied of a day when the house of the Lord would be far greater than anything in the past. His prophecies encouraged the people so greatly, that they worked diligently on the temple to complete it. There was no shortage of funds, because Darius had agreed to pay for the services of the people in this work. The chiefs of the fathers, and the priests, and High Priests, and even Zerubbabel, were to oversee the work. All the young men 20 years old, and older, did the actual labor. Haggai and Zechariah preached and kept them with the desire to do this according to the will of God. Cyrus had written instructions that the LORD had given him, and Darius and Artaxerxes gave orders of how it was to be finished too.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Verses 15-17: The temple was completed (in 515 B.C.), about 23 years after the project was started. Although this was a time of great celebration and blessing, the number of sacrifices they offered was less than those offered when Solomon dedicated the first temple (1 Kings 8:63). The people were not as prosperous or as numerous as they were before the exile. The priestly divisions are described (in 1 Chron. Chapter 24).</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:15 "And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king."</strong></p>
<p>The twelfth month of the year with the Jews, and answers to part of our February and part of March.</p>
<p>"Which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the king": Four years after the decree came forth.</p>
<p>“Adar … sixth year”: The 12<sup>th</sup> month (Feb./Mar.; in 516 B.C.).</p>
<p>We find that from the time the foundation was laid until its completion, the temple was 23 years in the building. After God sent Haggai and Zechariah to them, it took 4 years and 5 months. Many of the 23 years there was nothing done on it all. Adar was the twelfth month on their calendar. It would be equivalent to our March.</p>
<p>5. ____________________________. Ezra 6:16-18.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The Jews dedicate the Temple</span>. “<sup>16 </sup><em>And the sons of Israel, the priests, the Levites and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. <sup>17 </sup>They offered for the dedication of this temple of God 100 bulls, 200 rams, 400 lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel 12 male goats, corresponding to the number of the tribes of Israel. <sup>18 </sup>Then they appointed the priests to their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses</em>.” (Ezra 6:16-18).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:16 "And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,"</strong></p>
<p>Those of the ten tribes that remained after the body of the people were carried captive, or came with the Jews at their return.</p>
<p>"The priests and the Levites, and the rest of the children of the captivity": Those of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin.</p>
<p>"Kept the dedication of this house of God with joy": They set it apart for sacred use and service, with feasting and other expressions of joy and gladness (as follows in verse 17).</p>
<p>This dedication was on the order of the dedication that Solomon did, when he and the people dedicated the temple the first time. This was a time of great joy, because they were re-united in fellowship with their God. They suddenly had a place of worship. At this point, the people were really home.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:17 "And offered at the dedication of this house of God a hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel".</strong></p>
<p>Hecatombs (a great public sacrifice), of various sorts, which were always reckoned grand sacrifices, even among Heathens, of which Homer sometimes speaks. Some of these were for burnt offerings, and others peace offerings, by way of thankfulness to God for the finishing of the temple. Part of which belonging to those offering, as they feasted upon it with great gladness of heart.</p>
<p>"And for a sin offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel". For though the ten tribes were carried captive by Shalmaneser, yet, as before observed, there were some of them that remained in the land, and others that went and returned with the two tribes. And therefore, a sin offering was made for them all, for the typical act of making amends of guilt contracted since they had been in a Heathen land and temple service had ceased.</p>
<p>This number of animals offered were many less than was offered by Solomon at his dedication, and fewer even than those offered by Hezekiah. We must remember however, that there were not nearly as many people living in Judah now as there were then. In Solomon's time, all 12 tribes were included.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:18 "And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites in their courses, for the service of God, which [is] at Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses."</strong></p>
<p>“Divisions” (compare 1 Chron. Chapter 24), where the priestly divisions are delineated. Although David arranged the priest and Levites in order according to families, it was Moses who assigned their rights, privileges and duties (see notes on Num. chapters 3 and 4).</p>
<p>The book of Moses”: I.e., the Torah, “Hebrew; or Pentateuch, “Greek translation; or, the Law of Moses; which are all the first five books of the bible.</p>
<p>Everything was done as it was prescribed in the book of Moses. We remember, that the priests were Levites too. Not all Levites were priests however. Some were keepers of the doors. Some were singers and musicians. All Levites were set aside for the service of the Lord. Just a few were priests.</p>
<p>6. ________________________. Ezra 6:19-21.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The Jews observe the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread</span>. “<sup>19 </sup><em>The exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth of the first month. <sup>20 </sup>For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were pure. Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the exiles, both for their brothers the priests and for themselves. <sup>21 </sup>The sons of Israel who returned from exile and all those who had separated themselves from the impurity of the nations of the land to join them, to seek the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God of Israel, ate the Passover.</em>” (Ezra 6:19-21).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Verses 19-21; The Passover was celebrated by Jews who had returned from exile and by recent converts who had abandoned (“separated … unto them”), from the other religions (“the filthiness of the heathen of the land”), to follow Israel’s God.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:19 "And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth [day] of the first month."</strong></p>
<p>“Passover” (compare Lev. 23:4-8). Other notable Passovers include Hezekiah’s (2 Chron. 30:1-22) and Josiah’s (2 Chron. 35:1-19).</p>
<p>“First month”: March/April.</p>
<p>The returned exiles were spoken of as Israel. Not all who returned were of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Some were from the other 10 tribes and all of the people of the various tribes, who came back into the land, kept the Passover. This day is approximately the 14th day of April by our calendar. Passover was a remembrance of the night in Egypt, when death passed over the Hebrew houses that had the blood of a lamb over and around their doors. This was the 10<sup>th</sup> plague God sent on Egypt to free the children of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:20 "For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them [were] pure, and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for themselves."</strong></p>
<p>They were all to a man pure, and all purified as one man. All were of one mind to purify themselves, and took care to do it, and did it with as much dispatch as if only one man was purified. So that they were more generally prepared for service now than in the times of Hezekiah (2 Chron. 29:34).</p>
<p>"And killed the passover for all the children of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests and for themselves”. Which seems to have been done by the Levites, for themselves and for the priests, and for all the people, who were not so pure as the priests and Levites. Or otherwise they might have killed it themselves (Exodus 12:6).</p>
<p>The priests were anointed to the LORD while they were in the temple for service. In this case, it seems that all of the Levites, for all of the various services were anointed with the anointing oil for service.</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:21 "And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,"</strong></p>
<p>“The filthiness of the heathen of the land”: These were proselytes (a person who has converted from one religion to another, especially recently), to Judaism, who had confessed their spiritual uncleanness before the Lord, been circumcised, and renounced idolatry to keep the Passover (verse 22).</p>
<p>The passover lamb was eaten by all of the people sacrificing. Each family had a lamb the size their family could eat in one night. This Passover is very similar to communion that the Christians partake of. The lamb the Hebrews ate was symbolic of the body of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Lamb. The Unleavened Bread that we take at communion, also symbolizes the body of our Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>7. ____________________________________. Ezra 6:22.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">The Jews joyfully observe Feast of Unleavened Bread</span>. “<sup>22 </sup><em>And they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> had caused them to rejoice, and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them to encourage them in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</em>” (Ezra 6:22).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Verses 6:22 – 7:1: The book of Esther fits in this 59 year gap between the completion of the temple (ca. 516 B.C.), under Zerubbabel (Ezra chapters 1 through 6), and the second return (ca. 458 B.C.), under Ezra (Ezra Chapters 7 to 10; Ezra 4:6 provides a glimpse into this period also).</p>
<p><strong>Ezra 6:22 "And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy: for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel."</strong></p>
<p>The king of Assyria” was a title assigned to any Persian king (in this instance, Darius), who ruled the territory previously controlled by the Assyrians. The “Feast of Unleavened Bread” stated on the day immediately following the Passover feast (Exodus 12:15-20; Lev. 23:4-8; Num. 28:16-17).</p>
<p>“Turned the heart of the king of Assyria unto them”: By turning the heart of the king in their favor in allowing them to complete the rebuilding, God encouraged His people. They understood the verse, “The king’s heart is … in the hand of the Lord” (Prov. 21:1), better through this ordeal. The title “King of Assyria” was held by every king who succeeded the great Neo-Assyrian Empire regardless of what country they may have come from.</p>
<p>The celebration of Unleavened Bread overlaps Passover. We mentioned that the Unleavened Bread symbolizes the LORD Jesus Christ who is the Bread of life. It must be unleavened, because He was without sin. We partake of His righteousness. "Seven" means spiritually complete. The king of Assyria recognizes the Lord as God.</p>
<p>1. (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/6/1-2/s_409001">Ezr 6:1-2</a>) A diligent search for the decree of Cyrus.</p>
<p>Then King Darius issued a decree, and a search was made in the archives, where the treasures were stored in Babylon. And at Achmetha, in the palace that <em>is</em> in the province of Media, a scroll was found, and in it a record <em>was</em> written thus:</p>
<p>a. <strong>Then King Darius issued a decree, and a search was made</strong>: This was the response to the respectful request made by Tattenai described in the last part of <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/5/1-17/s_408001">Ezra 5</a>.</p>
<p>b. <strong>At Achmetha … a scroll was found</strong>: This indicates that there must have been some diligence required in the search. This in itself was an evidence of God's hand in the matter; otherwise, they might have easily given up the search.</p>
<p>i. "It is easy to realize how easily this might not have been found. If such a document was not in the proper libraries, what more natural than to abandon the search? But under the Divine compulsion that search was prosecuted until the decree was found." (Morgan)</p>
<p>ii. This request was initiated in Judea, referred to Babylon, and the answer was found in records from the remote city of <strong>Achmetha</strong>. All this gave the builders lots of time to continue their work, because they did not stop through the inquiry process (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/5/5/s_408005">Ezra 5:5</a>).</p>
<p>iii. "Diodorus (2.32.4) declared that the Persians had 'royal parchments' recording their history. Persian officials wrote on scrolls of papyrus and leather, as discoveries made in Egypt show." (Yamauchi)</p>
<p>iv. "In 'The Decrees of Cyrus' (p. 89), de Vaux observes that 'now we know that it was the custom of the Persian sovereigns to winter in Babylon and depart in the summer to Susa or Ecbatana, … and we also know that Cyrus left Babylon in the spring of 538 B.C. … A forger operating in Palestine without the information which we possess could hardly have been so accurate." (Yamauchi)</p>
<p>2. (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/6/3-5/s_409003">Ezr 6:3-5</a>) The text of the record found: Cyrus' decree.</p>
<p>In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus issued a decree <em>concerning</em> the house of God at Jerusalem: "Let the house be rebuilt, the place where they offered sacrifices; and let the foundations of it be firmly laid, its height sixty cubits <em>and</em> its width sixty cubits, <em>with</em> three rows of heavy stones and one row of new timber. Let the expenses be paid from the king's treasury. Also let the gold and silver articles of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple which <em>is</em> in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and taken back to the temple which <em>is</em> in Jerusalem, <em>each</em> to its place; and deposit <em>them</em> in the house of God";</p>
<p>a. <strong>King Cyrus issued a decree</strong>: This is the decree originally recorded in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/1/1-11/s_404001">Ezra 1</a>, giving the Jewish people who wanted to return to Jerusalem and Judea the right to return and to repopulate Judea and to rebuild Jerusalem.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Let the house be rebuilt … Let the expenses be paid from the king's treasury</strong>: Not only did Cyrus give <em>permission</em> for the temple to be rebuilt, he commanded the <em>funding</em> of the work from the royal <strong>treasury</strong>.</p>
<p>i. <strong>Heavy stones</strong>: "The <em>great stones</em> which had excited suspicion were now found to be expressly authorized - for the term is the same as for the 'huge stones' of 5:8 - literally, stones for rolling, too massive to be transported by other means." (Kidner)</p>
<p>ii. <strong>Heavy stones and one row of new timber</strong>: This construction technique seems to been a precaution against earthquakes. "Kenyon has identified as the only visible remains of Zerubbabel's building a straight joint of stones with heavy bosses about 108 feet north of the southeast corner of the temple platform, which Dunand confirmed as similar to Persian masonry found in Phoenicia." (Yamauchi)</p>
<p>iii. There is some question about the <em>size</em> of the temple as mentioned here, because these dimensions are greater than even Solomon's temple. The best answer is that Cyrus gave the <em>limits</em> of what they could build, instead of the actual dimensions of the new structure. "He did not command them to make it so large, for he left the ordering of the proportions of the building to their skill and choice; but he restrained them that they should make it no larger, lest they should hereafter make use of it to other purposes against himself." (Poole)</p>
<p>c. <strong>Let the gold and silver articles of the house of God … be restored and taken back to the temple which is in Jerusalem</strong>: Furthermore, Cyrus ordered that the spoils taken from the temple <em>some two generations before</em> be returned to the Jerusalem temple.</p>
<p>i. It was a remarkable example of God's providence that so many of these <strong>gold and silver articles of the house of God</strong> still existed intact and that King Cyrus commanded them to be returned.</p>
<p>3. (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/6/6-12/s_409006">Ezr 6:6-12</a>) The reply of Darius to Tattenai.</p>
<p>Now <em>therefore,</em> Tattenai, governor of <em>the region</em> beyond the River, and Shethar-Boznai, and your companions the Persians who <em>are</em> beyond the River, keep yourselves far from there. Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God on its site. Moreover I issue a decree <em>as to</em> what you shall do for the elders of these Jews, for the building of this house of God: Let the cost be paid at the king's expense from taxes <em>on the region</em> beyond the River; this is to be given immediately to these men, so that they are not hindered. And whatever they need; young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the request of the priests who <em>are</em> in Jerusalem; let it be given them day by day without fail, that they may offer sacrifices of sweet aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and his sons. Also I issue a decree that whoever alters this edict, let a timber be pulled from his house and erected, and let him be hanged on it; and let his house be made a refuse heap because of this. And may the God who causes His name to dwell there destroy any king or people who put their hand to alter it, or to destroy this house of God which is in Jerusalem. I Darius issue a decree; let it be done diligently.</p>
<p>a. <strong>Let the work of this house of God alone</strong>: Based on the search and recovery of the relevant document from King Cyrus, Darius made the appropriate command to <strong>Tattenai, governor of the region beyond the River</strong>. Darius commanded him to allow the work on the temple and the city of Jerusalem to continue without interruption.</p>
<p>b. <strong>Build the house of God on its site</strong>: Darius recognized what the <strong>elders of the Jews</strong> recognized, that it was essential to build the temple upon its old foundations.</p>
<p>c. <strong>Let the cost be paid at the king's expense</strong>: Based on the prior decree from Cyrus, King Darius did more than <em>allow</em> the work to continue. He commanded that it be <em>funded</em> by local <strong>taxes on the region beyond the River</strong>. Darius did what is common for politicians to do; he put the burden for funding this work on the province itself, not from his own treasury.</p>
<p>i. And it was funded in an impressive manner: <strong>whatever they need</strong> and <strong>let it be given to them day by day without fail</strong> mean that this was a substantial grant.</p>
<p>ii. In this, we see the wonderful hand of God at work with the objections raised by Tattenai and Shethar-Bozenai as recorded in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/5/3/s_408003">Ezra 5:3</a>. The end result of these objections was to <em>further</em> the work of God instead of hindering it. This is an example of God working all things together for good for His people (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/romans/8/28/s_1054028">Romans 8:28</a>). On this point, Kidner quotes a line from a William Cowper poem: <em>The clouds which ye so much dread, Are big with mercy</em>.</p>
<p>d. <strong>And pray for the life of the king and his sons</strong>: This explains part of the motivation of King Darius. Not only did he base his decision on the precedent of King Cyrus, but he also wanted the prayers of the Jewish people for <strong>the king and his sons</strong>.</p>
<p>e. <strong>Let him be hanged on it … let his house be made a refuse heap … destroy any king or people who put their hand to alter it</strong>: Finally, Darius was careful to make the decree <em>strong</em>, with severe punishments against those who violated both the letter and the spirit of the decree.</p>
<p>i. There is some debate as to if this punishment involved flogging a man at his own house, hanging him to death at his house, or impaling him at his house as an early form of crucifixion. "Whether this refers to the punishment of hanging and gibbeting, of whipping at a post, or of empaling, is not quite clear … Empaling, thrusting a sharp stake through the body till it comes out at the side of the neck, or hanging, seems to be intended here." (Clarke)</p>
<p>ii. Darius was the type of man to see such brutal executions through to completion. "According to Herodotus (3.159) Darius I impaled three thousand Babylonians when he took Babylon, an act that Darius himself recorded in the Beshitun Inscription." (Yamauchi)</p>
<p>f. <strong>Let it be done diligently</strong>: At the end of it all, the king of the mightiest empire on the earth commanded that the temple be finished by the returned exiles and funded by the empire.</p>
<p>i. This might seem absolutely unique, but there is good evidence that Persian monarchs had similar concern for the conquered temples in other regions of their empire. "In 1973 French archaeologists discovered at Xanthos in Lycia in southwestern Turkey a cult foundation charter - written in Greek, Lycian, and Aramaic - dated to 358 B.C., a period when the area was controlled by a Persian satrap, that provided some striking parallels with the decree of Cyrus." (Yamauchi)</p>
<p>ii. "One can easily imagine with what surprise Tattenai received the answer of Darius, characterized by clearness and determination. The man who would have hindered and stayed the progress of the building, was compelled not only to hinder, but to help with great gifts." (Morgan)</p>
<p>iii. "If certain matters can only be settled by reference to great men, kings or men of affairs, make the application;' and then betake yourself to prayer, believing that as He inclined the heart of Darius, in the instance before us, so He can do as He will among the armies of heaven, and the inhabitants of earth." (Meyer)</p>
<p>iv. This is a powerful illustration of the principle from Proverbs: <em>The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, like the rivers of water; He turns it wherever He wishes.</em> (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/proverbs/21/1/s_649001">Proverbs 21:1</a>)</p>
<p>B. The temple is finished and dedicated.</p>
<p>1. (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/6/13-15/s_409013">Ezr 6:13-15</a>) The temple is completed.</p>
<p>Then Tattenai, governor of <em>the region</em> beyond the River, Shethar-Boznai, and their companions diligently did according to what King Darius had sent. So the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they built and finished <em>it,</em> according to the commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the command of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia. Now the temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.</p>
<p>a. <strong>Diligently did according to what King Darius had sent</strong>: They were diligent in supporting and funding the work of rebuilding the temple, and were diligent in punishing anyone who opposed it.</p>
<p>i. "The political motives for this forthrightness may have been many, including a desire to show respect for the policies of Cyrus and to promote stability in a part of the empire which was important for communications with Egypt, at a time when widespread unrest had only recently been quelled." (Kidner)</p>
<p>b. <strong>They prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the Prophet and Zechariah</strong>: The words and personal ministry of these post-exilic prophets was an important component in the success of the work. The work and the workers were genuinely strengthened by the word of God through these prophets.</p>
<p>i. The initial ministry of these prophets is mentioned in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/5/1-2/s_408001">Ezra 5:1-2</a>. There, the prophets had to encourage the people of God to resume the work after a significant period of inactivity. Now they had to encourage them to keep working when God had opened the doors for the work to be done. Even with the open doors, the work was still difficult and needed prophetic encouragement. God's blessing on the work did not make the work <em>easy</em> to do.</p>
<p>ii. "Work on the temple made little progress because of opposition and the preoccupation of returnees with their own homes (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/haggai/1/2-3/s_910002">Haggai 1:2-3</a>). Because they had placed their own interests first, God sent them famine as a judgment (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/haggai/1/5-6/s_910005">Haggai 1:5-6</a>, <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/haggai/1/10-11/s_910010">10-11</a>). Spurred by the preaching of Haggai and Zechariah, and under the leadership of Zerubbabel and Joshua, a new effort was begun (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/haggai/1/12-15/s_910012">Haggai 1:12-15</a>)." (Yamauchi)</p>
<p>c. <strong>The temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar, which was in the sixth year</strong>: This means that it took four years from the resumption of construction. It was such a big job that even with all doing the work <strong>diligently</strong> it was not quickly completed.</p>
<p>i. "The mention of Artaxerxes, who belongs to the next century, takes us forward to the restoration of the city walls by Nehemiah, which this king authorized. His name, as the third royal patron of Israel's rehabilitation, is added here to complete the picture, whether by the author or by an early scribe." (Kidner)</p>
<p>2. (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/6/16-18/s_409016">Ezr 6:16-18</a>) The dedication ceremony of the second temple.</p>
<p>Then the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the descendants of the captivity, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy. And they offered sacrifices at the dedication of this house of God, one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and as a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. They assigned the priests to their divisions and the Levites to their divisions, over the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the Book of Moses.</p>
<p>a. <strong>Celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy</strong>: There was a previous celebration, many years before at the founding of this second temple (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/3/1-13/s_406001">Ezra 3</a>). This was the celebration for the finishing of a functioning temple.</p>
<p>i. "The word for <em>dedication</em> (<em>hanukka</em>) was later to become the name of a festival in memory of the Temple's re-consecration in 165 B.C. after its profanation by Antiochus Epiphanes (<em>cf.</em> <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/john/10/22/s_1007022">John 10:22f</a>.)." (Kidner)</p>
<p>b. <strong>And they offered sacrifices</strong>: Compared to the dedication of Solomon's temple (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1kings/8/62-66/s_299062">1 Kings 8:62-66</a>), this was a meager dedication celebration. Solomon sacrificed some 142,000 animals at his dedication of the temple; here at the dedication of the second temple they only sacrificed a total of 712 animals.</p>
<p>i. However, given the relative wealth of Israel in the days of the first temple as compared to the second temple, the smaller gift recorded in Ezra may have been more beautiful to God.</p>
<p>ii. <strong>As a sin offering for all Israel twelve male goats</strong>: "It was a confession of failure but also faith. There was still atonement and still the covenant with the whole people - for this was the implication of the <em>twelve</em> sacrifices." (Kidner)</p>
<p>iii. The fact that sacrifice was made for the <em>twelve tribes</em> shows that regathered Israel had the real sense that they were the collective product of all twelve tribes, and there were not ten or any other number of "lost" tribes.</p>
<p>c. <strong>They assigned the priests to their divisions … as it is written in the Book of Moses</strong>: They took care to resume the proper priestly service as commanded by the <strong>Book of Moses</strong> and previous pattern of David.</p>
<p>i. Yet, <em>all</em> was not the same as in the previous service in the days of Solomon's temple. "The general plan of the second temple resembled the first. But the [Most Holy Place] was left empty as the ark of the covenant had been lost through the Babylonian conquest … [The Holy Place] was furnished with a table for showbread, the incense altar, and one menorah instead of Solomon's ten." (Yamauchi)</p>
<p>3. (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/6/19-22/s_409019">Ezr 6:19-22</a>) The first Passover celebrated in the second temple.</p>
<p>And the descendants of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth <em>day</em> of the first month. For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves; all of them <em>were ritually</em> clean. And they slaughtered the Passover <em>lambs</em> for all the descendants of the captivity, for their brethren the priests, and for themselves. Then the children of Israel who had returned from the captivity ate together with all who had separated themselves from the filth of the nations of the land in order to seek the LORD God of Israel. And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy; for the LORD made them joyful, and turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</p>
<p>a. <strong>The descendants of the captivity kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month</strong>: This shows that they were careful to keep the Passover according to the command of Moses, on the proper day. In keeping Passover they remembered the central act of redemption of the Old Testament, the deliverance of God's people from Egypt.</p>
<p>b. <strong>They slaughtered the Passover lambs for all the descendants of the captivity</strong>: In this, we see that the people themselves did not sacrifice the <strong>Passover lambs</strong>, rather the priests did this for them. It seems that there was no absolute custom for this; sometimes the people sacrificed the Passover lambs under the supervision of the priests and sometimes the priests did it for the people.</p>
<p>c. <strong>With all who had separated themselves from the filth of the nations of the land</strong>: Connected with the remembrance of deliverance of Passover was the <strong>Feast of Unleavened Bread</strong>, which marked the purity of God's delivered people.</p>
<p>i. <strong>The children of Israel who had returned from the captivity ate together with all who had separated themselves from the filth of the nations of the land in order to seek the LORD God of Israel</strong>: "This is a crucial verse for correcting the impression one might gain from <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/4/1-3/s_407001">Ezra 4:1-3</a> of a bitterly exclusive party … in reality we find that only the self-excluded were unwelcome. The convert found an open door, as Rahab and Ruth had done." (Kidner)</p>
<p>ii. "We may suspect a spirit of Jewish animosity in the ugly phrase 'the filthiness of the heathen.' But it was only too true that both the Canaanite and the Babylonian habits of life were disgustingly immoral. The same horrible characteristic is found among most of the heathen to-day. These degraded people are not simply benighted in theological error; they are corrupted by horrible vices. Missionary work is more than the propagation of Christian theology; it is the purging of Augean stables." (Adeney)</p>
<p>d. <strong>The LORD made them joyful</strong>: In the context of obedience and purity, they did not lose their joy. The purity of God's delivered people was <em>joyful</em> in its character (instead of dour). It also led them <strong>to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God</strong>.</p>
<p>i. "Do not be afraid of joy; when God makes you joyful, do not think it necessary to restrain your songs or smiles." (Meyer)</p>
<p>ii. "So ends the first stage, a generation long, of Israel's rehabilitation. It has opened when the Lord 'stirred up the spirit of Cyrus (<a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/ezra/1/1/s_404001">Ezra 1:1</a>), and it concluded with His turning the heart of one of that king's most powerful successors." (Kidner)</p>
<p>iii. <strong>The heart of the king of Assyria</strong>: "He had 'turned the heart of the king of Assyria' - a title for Darius that speaks for the authenticity of the narrative, for it represents an old form of speech for the ruler of the districts that had once belonged to the king of Assyria." (Adeney)</p>
