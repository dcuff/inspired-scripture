<p>Genesis 39: Seven Lessons on Suffering for God from Joseph’s Suffering in Egypt</p>
<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span>: Genesis Chapter 39 is most frequently remembered for Joseph’s virtue in resisting the unwanted sexual advances of Potiphar’s wife, the oldest recorded account of workplace sexual harassment. Yet, the story is much more than this. The story beings with Joseph’s suffering from being sold as a slave. The story ends with his suffering for being placed in jail for a crime that he did not commit. Thus, everything that happens in this chapter must be seen through the lens of suffering and how suffering frequently fits into God’s greater plans for you.</p>
<p>Jesus invites every person who wants to follow Him to first “count the costs.” (Lk. 14:28). Being a believer does not mean that God is going to change your environment to make everything peaceful. Instead, He wants to send you into places where you will suffer to bring light to the lost. In order to prepare you for this, He must first burn away the things of the flesh that might make you a bad witness for Him. His process of refining you frequently includes suffering. In order to create a diamond, tremendous heat and pressure must be applied to coal.</p>
<p>Joseph had to descend into darkness three times before he was ready for God exalt him as His appointed savior. First, he descended into a wilderness pit that his brothers put him in. Second, he descended into Egypt and worked as a lowly slave. Third, he descended into a prison dungeon. In each place, he suffered. Yet, his suffering was necessary for God’s greater plans. From Joseph’s suffering, God reveals seven reasons why He allows godly people to suffer.</p>
<p><span class="underline">First</span>, Joseph went from being groomed by his father to lead his family to being a lowly slave for Potiphar, a servant of Pharaoh. From this, God reveals that He may allow you to suffer as He molds you to be a leader for Him. <span class="underline">Second</span>, Joseph faithfully suffered as a slave and greatly blessed a pagan-worshipping Egyptian. From this, God reveals that He may allow you to suffer to help others for the greater good of His kingdom. <span class="underline">Third</span>, God allowed Joseph to be tested by Potiphar’s wife. When Joseph previously told his brothers about his dreams, he gave no credit to God. Here, after being refined in suffering, Joseph responded with virtue by telling her that her desires were a sin against both his earthly and heavenly masters. From this, God reveals that He may test you and allow you to suffer to boost your faith in Him. <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, Joseph suffered from Potiphar’s wife’s continued sexual advances and eventually fled. From this, God reveals that He sometimes allows you to suffer to protect you from temptation. <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, Potiphar’s wife made false accusations against Joseph. These false accusations would eventually rescue him from her by placing him in jail. From this, God reveals that He may allow you to suffer to keep you pure from sin for His use. <span class="underline">Sixth</span>, Joseph was humbled and placed in captivity for a crime he did not commit. From this, God reveals that He may allow you to suffer and be humbled so that He can exalt you at a later time without pride. <span class="underline">Finally</span>, Joseph descended into the darkness of a prison dungeon and brought blessings to those trapped in darkness. From this, God reveals that He may allow you to suffer so that you can bring His light and hope to those who have none. If He has healed you of an addiction or an illness, He wants you to bring hope to others who are suffering.</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">God May Allow You to Suffer to Mold You to Be a Leader For Him</span>. Gen. 39:1.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Joseph’s descended from prince to servant to save his world</span>. Jacob had groomed his favorite son Joseph to lead his family. God would one day have Joseph fulfill this calling. He would one day save both his family and many others. Yet, before God would place him in this position, He first had to prepare Joseph by molding him through suffering as a slave to be a servant leader: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the bodyguard, bought him from the Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there</em>.” (Gen. 39:1). Even though Joseph’s brothers sold him out of jealous, greed and hatred, God was in control. He used their evil for His greater plans: “Now do not be grieved or angry with yourselves, because you sold me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.” (Gen. 45:5). “As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present result, to preserve many people alive.” (Gen. 50:20). “He sent a man before them, Joseph, who was sold as a slave.” (Ps. 105:17). As He did with Joseph, God frequently uses suffering to mold His people for His greater plans.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God’s hidden wisdom in sending Joseph to suffer as a slave in Potiphar’s house</span>. God knew in advance that He would make Joseph the second most powerful person in Egypt (Gen. 45:8). Yet, He had to prepare Joseph for this role. In the Promised Land, he taught Joseph the valuable skills of management, love, and compassion by having him serve as a shepherd. Making Joseph a slave in Egypt taught him the importance of humility and placing the needs of others before himself. Before he could lead others, he had to learn to empty himself of his own ambitions. He would also use this opportunity to teach Joseph the Egyptian language and culture. Without these things, he never could have led Egypt. Finally, to be a servant of God he had to learn to be patient and trust in God’s plans: “Love is patient, . . .,” (1 Cor. 13:4). Like Joseph, will you trust in God’s greater plans, even if they are not clear to you?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jesus also descended from royalty to servanthood to save the world</span>. Joseph foreshadowed Jesus. Like Joseph, Jesus emptied himself of his glory to become a servant. “but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men.” (Phil 2:7). “just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.” (Matt. 20:28). “For who is greater, the one who reclines at the table or the one who serves? Is it not the one who reclines at the table? But I am among you as the one who serves.” (Lk. 22:27; Jo. 13:12). “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.” (2 Cor. 8:9). His suffering brought life to the world (John 3:16).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">God frequently uses suffering to mold His people</span>. Like Joseph, God allowed the Jews to suffer in the wilderness to remold them into His people. “Behold, I have refined you, but not as silver; I have tested you in the furnace of affliction.” (Is. 48:10). “For You have tried us, O God; You have refined us as silver is refined.” (Ps. 66:10). “And I will bring the third part through the fire, refine them as silver is refined, and test them as gold is tested.” (Zech. 13:9(a)). “You shall remember all the way which the LORD your God has led you in the wilderness these forty years, that He might humble you, testing you . . . He humbled you and let you be hungry, . . .” (Dt. 8:2-3). Will you trust Him as he molds you in affliction?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Jesus also calls upon you to suffer as a servant for His Kingdom</span>. Like Joseph, God also calls upon you to give up your place of comfort and suffer as a servant for His Kingdom: “It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave;” (Matt. 20:26-7). “Sitting down, He called the twelve and said to them, ‘If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all.’” (Mk. 9:35). “And He said to them, ‘The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and those who have authority over them are called ‘Benefactors.’ But it is not this way with you, but the one who is the greatest among you must become like the youngest, and the leader like the servant.”’ (Lk. 22:25-6). This type of servitude frequently requires that you suffer for the benefit of others: “Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.” (2 Tim. 2:3). “Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ’s sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong.” (2 Cor. 12:10). Will you suffer as a servant for His Kingdom?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Find joy and peace in the midst of your tribulations for Jesus</span>. Joseph had joy and peace in his suffering. “Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you encounter various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance.” (Ja. 1:2-3). “And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations, knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance;” (Ro. 5:3). When you suffer, you can also find peace in Jesus: “These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.” (Jo. 16:33). “Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful.” (Jo. 14:27; Phil. 4:7; Col. 3:15). When you suffer, do you look for Jesus’ peace?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. <span class="underline">God Allows You to Suffer to Bless Others to Benefit His Kingdom</span>. Gen. 39:2-6a.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="underline">Joseph’s blessings upon Potiphar as a Servant</span>. As a transformed, lowly slave, God used Joseph to bless those whom he served for God’s greater plans: “<sup>2 </sup><em>The <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was with Joseph, so he became a successful man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. <sup>3 </sup>Now his master saw that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was with him and how the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> caused all that he did to prosper in his hand. <sup>4 </sup>So Joseph found favor in his sight and became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he owned he put in his charge. <sup>5 </sup>It came about that from the time he made him overseer in his house and over all that he owned, the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> blessed the Egyptian’s house on account of Joseph; thus the <span class="smallcaps">Lord’s</span> blessing was upon all that he owned, in the house and in the field. <sup>6 </sup>So he left everything he owned in Joseph’s charge; and with him there he did not concern himself with anything except the food which he ate</em>.” (Gen. 39:2-6a). It might be easy to read this text and assume that Joseph did not suffer. That is a mistake. He suffered over the loss of his freedom, his father, and his family. Yet, he did not complain. He used His God-given gifts to prosper others. In so doing, he in turn was blessed: “Joseph was blessed, wonderfully blessed, even in the house where he was a slave. God’s presence with us, makes all we do prosperous. Good men are the blessings of the place where they live; good servants may be so, though mean and lightly esteemed. The prosperity of the wicked is, one way or other, for the sake of the godly. Here was a wicked family blessed for the sake of one good servant in it.” (Mathew Henry on Gen. 39). Many frequently measure success in monetary terms or in terms of worldly importance. Yet, Joseph shows that God does not measure His blessings in monetary terms. Frequently, He blesses believers so that believers can bless others to serve His Kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">When you suffer as a faithful servant, you also will find God’s favor</span>. Even though he suffered as a slave, Joseph showed godly virtue by faithfully working for Potiphar. Slavery is an evil man-made institution. Yet, believers are still called upon to be faithful to whoever they are serving. When you suffer as a faithful servant, you too will find God’s favor: “Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. For this finds favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly. For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? <em>But if when you do what is right and suffer for it you patiently endure it, this finds favor with God</em>. For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps,” (1 Pet. 2:18-21). “Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in the sincerity of your heart, as to Christ;” (Ep. 6:5). “Slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth, not with external service, as those who merely please men, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.” (Col. 3:22). “All who are under the yoke as slaves are to regard their own masters as worthy of all honor so that the name of God and our doctrine will not be spoken against.” (1 Tim. 6:1). “Urge bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, not pilfering, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect.” (Titus 2:9-10). Even if you suffer under a mean supervisor, will you be a faithful employee and witness?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">When you suffer for Him, God will also prosper you, yet not always financially</span>. As a faithful servant, God prospered Joseph (Gen. 39:2-3). Yet, this did not mean that Joseph ever received a financial reward. As a slave, his only reward was inside. This fact may help to interpret God’s many promises to prosper believers when so many believers struggle financially. “Prosperity” in God’s eyes is not measured in financial terms. It is instead a measure of success in serving others in order to build His Kingdom. “He who trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like the green leaf.” (Prov. 11:28). For example, God prospered David at a time when he in fact had few possessions: “David was prospering in all his ways for the LORD was with him. When Saul saw that he was prospering greatly, he dreaded him.” (1 Sam. 18:14-5). God’s blessings to Joshua also were not financial: “So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.” (Josh. 6:27). His prosperity brings the peace and joy of the Spirit and eternal life: “He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in its season and its leaf does not wither; <em>and in whatever he does, he prospers</em>.” (Ps. 1:3). “For he will be like a tree planted by the water, that extends its roots by a stream and will not fear when the heat comes; but its leaves will be green, and it will not be anxious in a year of drought nor cease to yield fruit.” (Jer. 17:8). “<em>The righteous man will flourish</em> like the palm tree, he will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.” (Ps. 92:12). “Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be in the country.” (Dt. 28:3). Do you see His blessings even when you have no money?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Give God the credit when He blesses you to lead others to Him</span>. Joseph most likely used his skills as a shepherd to increase the size and health of Potiphar’s flocks. Potiphar was an Egyptian idol worshipper. He could have easily interpreted his good fortune to one of the countless Egyptian gods. Yet, he gave credit to Yahweh: “<em>his master saw that the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> was with him and how the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> caused all that he did to prosper in his hand</em>.” (Gen. 39:3). This would only be possible if Joseph attributed his success to Yahweh. For Joseph to praise Yahweh for his successes also shows how much God had transformed him through his suffering. When he was in the Promised Land and had a dream of his family and all creation bowing to him, he did not give credit to God (Gen. 37:5-11). Failing to give God the credit when He does a good work in you can give rise to the evil sin of pride. When God blesses you in your work or in other areas, do you give credit for your success to Him?</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">If you are not a servant, become Christ’s slave and use His gifts to serve others in need</span>. For many westerners, wealth or other financial assistance has freed them from the need to live as servants. This is a good thing. Christ came to free His people from all forms of bondage and slavery (Is. 61:1-2). Yet, He wants to use your God-given freedom, to become His slave. You do this by submitting to others for His Kingdom. “Were you called while a slave? Do not worry about it; but if you are able also to become free, rather do that. For he who was called in the Lord while a slave, is the Lord’s freedman; likewise <em>he who was called while free, is Christ’s slave</em>.” (1 Cor. 7:21-22). Each person has been given gifts of the Spirit to help others. “But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.” (1 Cor. 12:7, 8-11). Joseph had a God-given gift of administration. He used this gift to first prosper Potiphar’s house. Later, he prospered the jail where he served. Later, he prospered all of Egypt. Are you using your God-given gifts for the Lord and those around you?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>3. <span class="underline">God May Allow You to Suffer to Strengthen Your Faith</span>. Gen. 39:6b-9.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Joseph’s refusal to sin against his earthly and heavenly masters</span>. Like his mother Rachel, Joseph was blessed with good looks. Yet, Satan knew God’s plan and tried to make it fail. He used his good looks and his elevated status to cause Potiphar’s wife to be overcome with lust. She then sought to entice Joseph. Yet, Joseph showed that he was a man of God by refusing to dishonor either his earthly or heavenly masters: “<sup>6 b</sup> <em>Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance. <sup>7 </sup>It came about after these events that his master’s wife looked with desire at Joseph, and she said, ‘Lie with me.’ <sup>8 </sup>But he refused and said to his master’s wife, ‘Behold, with me here, my master does not concern himself with anything in the house, and he has put all that he owns in my charge. <sup>9 </sup>There is no one greater in this house than I, and he has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil and sin against God?</em>’” (Gen. 39:6b-9). It might be easy to read these verses and also conclude that Joseph did not suffer from these flattering sexual advances. Yet, he was 17 when he was sold into slavery. He was at the height of his hormonal rages. He was also lonely. He also had no promise that he would ever be free to marry a woman. When Potiphar’s wife was alone with Joseph, he could have given in to her advances and experienced a moment of pleasure without being caught. He no doubt suffered torment. Yet, he refused to do evil in God’s eyes (Gen. 39:9). He knew that adultery was not just a sin against Potiphar. It was also sin against God (Ps. 51:4). He also knew that God would have known his sins if he had agreed. When he failed to stop her advances, he eventually fled (Gen. 39:12). God was testing him in the small things to build up his faith so that he would be faithful with the larger tests that would await him with power in Pharaoh’s court.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Jesus also refused to sin against His heavenly master</span>. Like Joseph, Jesus also suffered from the devil’s efforts to tempt Him. After Jesus spent 40 days in the wilderness, He was hungry. Satan tested Him saying that He could end His hunger by turning the rocks around Him into bread (Matt. 4:3). Jesus responded by quoting Deuteronomy 8:3: “It is written, ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.”’ (Matt. 4:4). The words that Jesus quoted were in direct reference to Him as the Messiah. In Hebrew, a definite article appears before the word “man.” The sentence is literally translated as “<em>the</em> man does not live by bread alone, but <em>the</em> man lives by every word of God.” Jesus was referred to 88 times in the New Testament as the “son of Man.” This was a reference to Him as the Messiah. Jesus was telling the devil that “the Messiah” lives upon God’s Word, not bread. Jesus would not take the shortcuts that the devil offered. Nor should you. Jesus was the Word that came from God’s mouth and became flesh (John 1:1, 14). Just as Satan sought to tempt Jesus in times of weakness, he will try to do the same with you.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Memorize God’s Commandments to protect you from the evil enticements of sinners</span>. Many today sadly see little value in God’s Commandments and His written Word. Yet, if you treasure His Commandments and His Word in your heart, He will guide you away from the evil desires of sinners: “My son, observe the commandment of your father and do not forsake the teaching of your mother; bind them continually on your heart; tie them around your neck. When you walk about, <em>they will guide you; when you sleep, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk to you. . . To keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress</em>.” (Prov. 6:20-22, 24). “To deliver you from the strange woman, from the adulteress who flatters with her words;” (Prov. 2:16). “My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.” (Prov. 1:10). “I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people;” (1 Cor. 5:9). “Do not participate in the unfruitful deeds of darkness, but instead even expose them;” (Eph. 5:11). Have you memorized His Word and His Commandments?</p>
<p><span class="underline">Fear God because there is no sin that you can hide from Him</span>. When Potiphar’s wife was alone with Joseph, he could have given in to her advances and experienced a moment of pleasure without being caught. Yet, God would have known. “The eyes of the LORD are in every place, watching the evil and the good.” (Prov. 15:3). “And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.” (Heb. 4:13). It was the fear of God that kept Joseph from giving into temptation: “The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.” (Prov. 1:7; Ps. 111:10; Job 28:28). According the Bible, to fear the Lord you must hate evil: “The fear of the LORD is to hate evil. . .” (Prov. 8:13). Unlike Joseph, Judah showed that he had no fear of God. He refused to provide Tamar an heir and even sought out the temptation of temple prostitutes (Gen. 38:11-26). Do you fear God by hating evil?</p>
<p><span class="underline">Rebuke the devil, and he will flee</span>. God does not want you to engage with the devil. Instead, He has given you a tool that was not available to Joseph. He has</p>
