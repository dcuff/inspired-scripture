<p>2 Kings 22: Seven Lessons from King Josiah on Finding Spiritual Renewal Through God’s Word</p>
<p><span class="underline">Introduction</span>: 2 Kings 22-23 describe the reforms and blessings that came to Judah under King Josiah. Judah suffered under the idolatry of his grandfather Manasseh and his father Amon. Because of their actions, God pronounced Judah’s judgment (2 Kgs. 21:10-17). Yet, Josiah rejected the evil ways of his predecessors. He instead obeyed God’s Word to a greater degree than any king before or after him (2 Kgs. 23:25). He led Judah in a revival. As a result of his actions, God delayed His judgment upon Judah to give the people another opportunity to change their ways. From Josiah’s actions, God reveals seven lessons for obtaining spiritual renewal. These include: (1) faith-led obedience, (2) worship, (3) learning God’s Word, (4) repentance, (5) fearing God, (6) intercessory prayers, and (7) finding peace by trusting God’s Word.</p>
<p><span class="underline">First</span>, Josiah was one of the greatest kings because he acted with faith-led obedience to God’s Word. Through his example, God reveals that renewal starts with faith and obedience to His Word. <span class="underline">Second</span>, Josiah’s reforms included the restoration of the Temple for proper worship. Through Josiah’s example, God reveals that renewal also requires a restored worship focused on God that is guided by His Word. <span class="underline">Third</span>, Josiah’s reforms included the discovery of the law that was hidden inside the Temple. Through this example, God reveals that renewal requires learning and memorizing His Word. <span class="underline">Fourth</span>, upon hearing God’s Word, Josiah felt convicted and repented for God’s people. Through Josiah’s example, God reveals that renewal requires the conviction of sin and repentance. <span class="underline">Fifth</span>, God revealed that His judgment upon the Jews would be delayed but not removed. This was because they did not fear God and returned to their sins after Josiah. From the Jews’ mistakes, God reveals that renewal requires that you fear His Word by hating evil. <span class="underline">Sixth</span>, God delayed Judah’s judgment because of Josiah’s intercessory prayers. From Josiah’s example, God reveals that renewal should include intercessory prayers. <span class="underline">Finally</span>, Josiah found peace even though he still suffered. From Josiah’s example, God also reveals that renewal includes finding peace by trusting His Word, even when you experience pain or sorrow.</p>
<p>1. <span class="underline">Faith &amp; Obedience: Renewal Starts With Faith and Obedience to the Word</span>. 2 Kgs. 22:1-2</p>

<li><p><span class="underline">Josiah becomes King of Judah and faithfully obeys God’s Word</span>. After Judah’s two worst kings, God blessed Judah with one of its greatest kings: “<sup>1</sup> <em>Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem; and his mother’s name was Jedidah the daughter of Adaiah of Bozkath. <sup>2 </sup>He did right in the sight of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> and walked in all the way of his father David, nor did he turn aside to the right or to the left</em>.” (2 Kgs. 22:1-2; 2 Chr. 34:1-2). In 639 B.C., Josiah became King as an eight-year-old boy. In God’s providence, He spared Josiah’s formulative years from his father Amon’s wicked influences. Because of Josiah’s faith-led obedience, God blessed him with a 31-year-reign, from 640 to 609 BC. Also because of his faith-led obedience and reforms, God blessed Judah with three decades of peace, prosperity, and renewal.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Josiah was a great spiritual reformer</span>. Josiah was possibly Judah’s greatest king. At age 16, he earnestly sought God. By age 20, he began to actively purge Judah of its idolatry and pagan influences: “For in the eighth year of his reign while he was still a youth, he began to seek the God of his father David; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Asherim, the carved images and the molten images. They tore down the altars of the Baals in his presence, and the incense altars that were high above them he chopped down; also the Asherim, the carved images and the molten images he broke in pieces and ground to powder and scattered it on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. Then he burned the bones of the priests on their altars and purged Judah and Jerusalem.” (2 Chron. 34:3-5). Amongst all of Judah’s kings, only Hezekiah had a similar courage to purge the country of its pagan influences (2 Kgs. 18:3-6). Yet, Hezekiah also sinned (2 Kgs. 20:12-19). In terms of the purity of his heart, Josiah exceeded Hezekiah and even David: “Before him there was no king like him who turned to the LORD with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might, according to all the law of Moses; nor did any like him arise after him.” (2 Kgs. 23:25).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Josiah’s reign was a fulfillment of a prophesy</span>. Approximately 300 years earlier during Jeroboam’s evil reign in Northern Israel, a man of God prophesized about the reformer King Josiah: “He cried against the altar by the word of the LORD, and said, ‘O altar, altar, thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name; and on you he shall sacrifice the priests of the high places who burn incense on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.”’’ (1 Kgs. 13:2). By removing the evil influences of his father Amon and grandfather Manasseh, Josiah fulfilled this prophesy.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="underline">Josiah’s obedience to God’s Word was unwavering</span>. The Bible records that Josiah “<em>did</em> [not] <em>turn aside to the right or to the left</em>.” (2 Kgs. 22:2). This reflected his faithful adherence to every aspect of God’s law: “So you shall observe to do just as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left.” (Dt. 5:32). “and do not turn aside from any of the words which I command you today, to the right or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.” (Dt. 28:14). “Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may have success wherever you go.” (Josh. 1:7). “Do not turn to the right nor to the left; turn your foot from evil.” (Prov. 4:27). If you pick and choose to follow the parts of God’s Word that you agree with, God can’t say the same about you. Is your obedience unwavering?</p></li>

<p>2. <span class="underline">Worship: Renewal Also Requires a Worship Guided by God’s Word</span>. 2 Kgs. 22:3-7.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Josiah sends his scribe to repair the Temple</span>. As part of his many reforms, Josiah repaired God’s Temple to restore proper worship in Judah: “<sup>3 </sup><em>Now in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe, to the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> saying, <sup>4 </sup>‘Go up to Hilkiah the high priest that he may count the money brought in to the house of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people. <sup>5 </sup>Let them deliver it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of</em></p>
